      "Kingdom of Dumpling is truly a hidden gem in San Francisco! The food is affordable and delicious. The service was pretty standard for Asian restaurants, however, and could have been better. My friends and I came on a weekday night around 8:30pm and it wasn't crowded at all. We were seated immediately, and decided to order the chow mein, shanghai pan-fried buns, and sizzling rice soup. The chow mein was made with hand pulled noodles and was super tasty! The pan-fried buns were probably my favorite dish; they were sooo crispy on the outside and had pork filling on the inside. The pork filling was super juicy and yummy and reminded me of the filling in xiao long baos. I only wish that there was more of the dumpling skin on the outside. The sizzling rice soup had good flavor but the rice wasn't crispy like how it is at San Tung. Kingdom of Dumpling has such delicious food that I would disregard the below average service to eat it. I can't wait to try more entrees next time!\n",

      "Came here right when they opened and that was great. No line. Got the xlb, sheng Jian bao, woodear mushrooms, pig ears, and dumplings. The xlb was good, skin not too thick, but thick enough so there are no holes. One of the better ones in sf. The dumplings were also pretty good, I liked the fish ones a lot. The pork and chive ones were great too, but the lamb ones had too much of that gamey taste.The pig ears were as expected. The woodear mushrooms weren't as soft as I would've liked...it's still got a bit of a crunch ( some might prefer that though).The sheng Jian bao, id pass on that. Is nothing like what you'd expect in China. The insides didn't have any juice either and the meat to bum ratio was just too much in favor of the bun.Stick to xlb and dumplings\n",

      "Aight. I come here for the BEEF TENDON and the ORANGE SPICY SAUCE on the table. I like it enough to put up with the sticky tables, stuffy air, and rude service. ** MY ORDER: Do not leave without ordering the BEEF TENDON. It's thinly sliced, salted to perfection, and garnished with cilantro. yumm! I'm usually not a fan of spice, but something about that ORANGE SAUCE hurts so good! While we're at it.. we also ordered soup dumplings and pork/cabbage dumps to dip in the sauce. They were nothing to CAPS about though. **OTHER: Infamous bad service. They always look like they're having a bad day. Had to ask for napkins 3 times, and they were stingy about it too. My friend started to tear off his napkin for me. We ordered chow fun, but they ran out of it and made chow mien without asking us before. I recommend just going there and putting your name down. Yelp waitlist isn't accurate! We were halfway done with our food when they notified my friend that our table was ready. Expect half effort washed plates and utensils. Prices are decent for SF. Free soda when you check in on yelp! Parking was fine for us on a weekday evening. They accept card. Bathroom two doors down.\n",

      "The Kingdom has gone down hill.   Recently, I did a delivery from this place because I missed it (my friends and i used to come here every single week!). So this week I decided to stop by with my friends in person to get their food again.  However, the treatment from this place went downhill from my past visits.  Let me explain to you the issues we had here.  First, when we ordered our food, we asked specifically if we can order more later on in case it wasn't enough and the waiter said it was ok.  However, that wasn't the case!  When we wanted to order more again, the waiter said \"No!\" and didn't even give us an explanation and just walked away!   Second- Aside from the attitude the waiter gave us, the food that day was horrible! The pan fried dumplings were horrible!  The ratio of the meat to the dough was like 3 to 1.  Since when did they become so stingy! I know things are expensive in California, but if you are going to be stingy with your items, you're going to lose some of your devoted customers!Third- This irks me the most.  We noticed that the waiter was super nice to the non-asian customers here. And the treated their Asian customers here with more attitude and no respect!  In the words of Eleanor from Crazy Rich Asians \"kaki lang\"  Why must your treat your Asian customers  with so much disrespect.  Show your \"kaki lang\" some respect! I used to come here every week back in the days, but now I can't even say when i'll be back ever again.  I will never return to this kingdom again!\n",

      "Horrible experience. We waited an hour before we got our food and they gave us the check before we even got our veggie dumplings. Also on the check they charged us $50 when it was a $35 order and when we tried to tell them the check was wrong they tried to justify it before even checking but we insisted they check again and once they realized they were wrong all they said was \"oh sorry\" but it was some racist bull. Horrible service, mediocre food. Never coming back again\n",

      "I only order dumplings, garlic string beans, and onion pancakes and I haven't been disappointed in the food. Food is flavorful and well cooked. Be prepared before you go, and know what you want to order as it's a place where you order your food all at once and that is it. It may feel like you are over ordering but you aren't. Example: my mom, her bf and I went and ordered the following and left full and content:Soup dumplings (x2)Chicken and Chinese spinach dumplings (x1)Shrimp and pork dumplings (x1)Spicy dumplings (x1) Onion pancakes (x1)Garlic string beans (x1) It isn't the cleanest place (I.e walls and carpet) but you're not eating off the walls or carpet soooo.\n",

We also ordered spicy dumplings, pig ears, cucumber salad, Thai tea - all were very tasty! A lot of the soup dumplings were torn by the time they served it to us, and they were willing to exchange the broken ones which was nice. Only one of them spoke English.\n",

      "I've attached a photo of some of the dumplings we got (3 of 5 dishes, mind you) but it honestly does not do it justice. I'm gonna focus more on the logistics of even getting a seat here more so than the food real quick, ok? People who say you should get here when they open are SO RIGHT because the place is a tiny hole in the wall and the restaurant is so so so tiny. There's a reason why it's crowded! It's because the food is so great and fresh! So it's truly a fight if you want it. My party of 8 got there 10 minutes before it opened and we got seated right away. With such a big party and the understanding of the hype around this place, we basically ordered every type of dumpling they offered. I LOVE THEM ALL. The best has got to be the one with corn because 1) I don't see corn dumplings very often around restaurants, 2) it's a wonderful mixture of sweet and savory in one bite - what's not to love? 12/10 would come here again!!\n",

We enjoyed the delicious lamb dumplings which I believe the owner recommends on the show, scallion pancake filled with chives and egg, spicy wonton which was ok and the soup dumplings.

I say yes, but express concern. He says \"Don't worry\". Ok I say. We're actually all there.10 min later they have arranged 4 tables in a diagonal pattern to accomodate us. We order a variety of delicious dumplings, noodles, soup dumplings, spicy won tons, seaweed salad etc. Also many beers. It worked out to a very reasonable amount of money and we had leftovers. Service good. Manager hilarious. Get a reservation.\n",

      "Not completely on board..But everybody (three of my friends and my cousin) except for my prefers this place over Dumpling Kitchen (except for me and my boyfriend) which was basically a block down the same street (before they decided to retire about a month ago). Anyways I came here on Saturday Night for my friend Trang's Birthday, we were a party of six (I would not recommend it any parties bigger than six.. Honestly the fewer the better. Five should be the ideal max.. Four or less seems like the perfect amount to go with. It's a pretty small place and you should know what you want to order: they're pretty on it. And there's always a line so you can't order any more once you've placed your order: so be sure. -The string beans were great.. The tofu noodles wasn't bad (made of tofu).-I do like the owner's enthusiasm. He knows for sure if it won't be enough food so he'll recommend you stuff (plus it also helps the business).-The dumplings weren't bad. I felt like there was more soup here and less meat. And apparently this place and Kitchen has the same supplier with meat. I do prefer the dumpling shell from Kitchen more. The food overall was good. I have been told that their chow fun/chow mein stuff isn't great though, but I can't confirm or deny something I haven't had..\n",

      "Haven't had such a odd and terrible dining experience in recent memory.Heading over with friends one Sunday evening, I put our party on the yelp waitlist en route. Upon arrival, there was no staff member to check in with and many people waiting outside. My friend and I went into the \"waiting room\" annex a couple doors down to get out of the cold and look over the menu. I went back to the front door to try to check in with a server several times and was ignored, plus we were still #7 on the waitlist outside the door as well as the app. Then a server came into the waiting room and said he was looking all over the place for us -- I was still #7 on the waitlist, no one had texted or called, and we were in their waiting room.. where else would we be? The server then left and never came back, so I went to find him and he said yes stay in the waiting room which had tables and sometimes they serve food there too I guess and they'll come take our order. Servers come clean the tables next to us and we ask if we can place our order, they say no. We go find the same main server who told us to wait earlier and he gives us an order pad to give to the servers cleaning. We place our orders and then continue to wait alone in this annex with loud karaoke music playing and people coming through to use the bathroom.The food eventually starts trickling in -- super underseasoned Beijing bean noodles and string beans. It's hard to make bland Chinese food but they did it. The chili oil wontons and chicken wings were underwhelming. They dropped off a plate of chow mein and I said no we ordered chow fun. The server said we ran out of those noodles, this is the same thing. No.. I wouldn't have ordered chow mein, you don't assume you can substitute. Soup dumplings weren't soupy at all. The dumplings were the only things I'd order again (we got the pork/corn and pork/chives) but would also go almost anywhere else for them. I guess good thing was we were in good company and being left alone in the waiting room means we took it upon ourselves to turn off the karaoke music and stream videos on YouTube instead. Also it was cheap so it wasn't like we sunk a ton of money on this bad experience. I shall never stray from King of NOODLE again. Similar menu and name obviously so I wondered if they were the same owners but I can't imagine the execution being so different.\n",

      "I usually loved coming here for authentic northern Chinese dumplings at a reasonable price. Though the wait for a table is typically not very short, that only means it's good and should be worth the wait. Service was never amazing, but it's a semi hole in the wall so you really can't ask for too much. Beside. I'm not here to eat the service, I'm here to eat the food. However, recently that has changed. ONE HOUR has elapsed since we gave our order. As I sat here longer and longer, dumpling-less, tea-less, and hopeless, my levels of excitement was decreasing faster than the DOW JONES after Trump took presidency. 30 more minutes later, and we finally got some dumplings. Not much apology was given.. but long story short. Be prepared to wait your asses here. Still though, 2 Stars for good dumplings. 6/10 might return.\n",

Spicy dipping sauce for beef tendons adds a \"kick\" I really enjoy that.Beef chow fun was good also. Noodles were fresh, crunchy julienned cabbage and beans spout makes a great dish. Just add a touch of soy sauce for more flavor. I least enjoy the fried rice. Rice was hard and dry, lack of flavor. I would enjoy better if they sweat the onions before adding the rice and the rest of ingredients. Portion size was satisfactory for the price. They have all my to go utensils except for the fortune cookies.\n"

      "Amazing soup and other dumplings in the Sunset neighborhoodWe got very lucky and did not have to wait in line, which is very normal for this place. It is very small inside with only 10-15 tables. For our group of 6 they put two tables together. We tried a variety of entrees and dumplings. The pea shoots with garlic are very tasty as was the eggplant with garlic. It definitely had spice but was not so hot that I didn't like it (I can't stomach food is too spicy). The soup dumplings are made perfectly as is everything else. Word to the wise. For the soup dumplings make sure they cool off or you'll burn your mouth. It is best to put in the soup ladle, bite the top and let it cool for a second. I did this and was not scorched by the hot hot and tasty soup inside.

We ordered pork dumplings, pea shoots, and wonton soup with house broth. Soup in the wonton soup tasted like water. No flavor or depth. It was very flat. Wonton wasn't too great either. They were more like huge wonton noodles. The filling in most of them ended up floating on top and wonton wrap served as noodles. The pork dumpling was also just okay. There wasn't that yummy delicious broth inside that I was expecting. The best dish we got that night was the pea shoots. I haven't had pea shoots I didn't like so maybe I just like them no matter what. Donuts were nice but too greasy for me. I'm not sure we'll go here again.

      "So let's talk about this place. I've eaten here maybe 30 40 times easily with friends and others family etc. Because dumplings were tasty even though service always was 2nd rate at best. I am ready to discard this Restaurant into the trash.  You may notice the reviews are suddenly getting to be pretty bad despite 2000 counting.  A really bad sign that it's about to close or be sold to an idiot who will be what's about to close.Yes dumplings are made off site at their other hole in the wall on noriega and they transport them in the trunk of their Lexus SUV and Toyota Camry car trunk.  Yes on trays openly exposed to the elements dust what have you.  Proudly walks in with them on cafeteria trays and plops them somewhere in back.This in front of lines of people waiting out front so no secret there. It's gone on for years and I figure their frozen and then steamed until hot and cooked so no biggie.Let's talk about the food .  It used to be order some dumplings even ask what's freshest  and enjoy  the slightly palpable freshness of what they had and then order what your standards are to fill out the meal.  I'd get the xiao lum bao of course, soup dumpling is actually pretty good and usually not broken so the broth inside can be enjoyed.  Having spent time in shanghai in my youth these are an important part of any dumpling meal.The kale and pork, chive and pork, lamb and carrot, even some others were all fine many times. I would always order some garlic string beans, some cucumber salad or the garlic marinated rehydrated mushroom salad,( called garlic fungher on the menu,) maybe so salt and pepper fried tofu.  Pretty good stuff for a long time. Over the course of the last 5 to 6 years quite a few good meals.Now for the bad:  be warned I admit to suffering through a incredibly bad experience to witness total ethical failure of this restuarant to do business honestly and fairly.I can in recently on July 2nd of 2019.  First I made it early before the real rush and was their at like 530.  I waited a very long time as special party ate in what is now their waiting area in the adjacent space and also a serving area now.  The staff were incredibly rude and short and ignoring everyone and I slowly began to realize something was actually wrong in the kitchen.  Having eaten here many times I trooped through it and waited longer and longer while I could see they weren't turning dishes out of the kitchen.  Something was wrong.  Something bad.  Fast forward to the end of our meal.  We've noticed our dumplings are under cooked , we've noticed all the dumplings which means frozen and require steam are coming out one at a time and are soggy I e not steamed but boiled in pot of water because they had like the entire stove failing which means it was dangerous for them to even be using it.  I did get an upset stomach from eating food which normally wouldn't have fazed me even slightly.  And the following day when I drove ny I found them shut down by the health department.  So.. I apologize to you all now.  I knew something was wrong and I wanted to barge in the kitchen with my camera rolling and say what the %? I should have but we will never get the real story out of these people.  I paid, tipped and will continue eating $$$ worth of food in other places and never support his joint again as they refused to be honorable and shut the place down themselves when it was obviously broken I was watching through the kitchen window as the one older lady slowly kept stirring her one pot of boiling water trying to cook dumplings.  When you run a business serving food in city like San Francisco and you dont have the integrettly to shut down because you cant make food you are a piece of garbage and deserve to be sued right out of business.  I advise anyone who ate here July 1, or 2, of 2019 to consider sharing their experience here and on google reviews to broadcast the clear culpability of the ownership, management, and staff, who were 100% complicit in serving unsafe food knowingly and with attitude to boot.  They do not deserve another chance.* Beer is lucky to be cold, even as proprietor hawks them happily asking if people want another round.  I dont know where he got the idea that a good sales technique is offer more beers when you just put them in the fridge and they are in no way actually cold.  I know many people especially chinese will say dont drink cold liquid with your meal but if your hawking beer it better be cold.\n",

Lying: There's one waitress that was nice but if my dish wasn't ready after a 40 min wait, I'd rather they tell me up front and let me just cancel the dish instead of lying and making me wait. I ordered dumplings, pea sprouts, beef noodles, and pan friend dumplings. The pan friend dumplings never came even after waiting 40 mins and was repeatedly told \"they are ready, we are packing them.\" The cherry on top: I asked for the check and a box 3 times and the 3 different waitresses that worked there just congregated in the kitchen instead of giving me my check or box. I asked 2 more times after waiting an additional 15 mins (on top of the 40 mins waiting for the pan friend dumpling) and finally got it. Paid cash instead of card because I couldn't stand waiting another 30 mins.\n",

      "service was off. we were told we couldn't order the pan fried dumplings because we had 2 pan fried items already and it would take too long to make them. I've never been limited on what to order before! The place is small and the silverware and plates were dirty. The tea wasn't hot, the hot sauce on the table smelled a bit, and the waiter's attitude was just odd. Overall this was a miss. We came because the dumpling place down the street closed down, unfortunately we will not be back.Xlb - my favorite! These were quite good, however they didn't provide us with spoons, they didn't have the fresh ginger slices for the vinegar, and the chili oil wasn't flavorful.Beef pancake - this was hot and fresh from the frying pan . It was very oily, but also very tasty. I had some trouble breathing because the heaviness is the oil. Onion pancake - so oily, not flakey or crispy, a bit of a disappointment. I loved getting this from the dumpling place that closes down the street, so this was just a sad dish for me. Napa cabbage/green chives + pork dumpling - these were not extremely hot when we got them. The green chives weren't very flavorful as expected. This was just okay. I asked for the chili oil as the hot sauce on the table was a bit strange looking\n",

      "OMG！！！Crazy place！I'm not a strict customer，but I have to say：IT IS MUCH WORSE THAN THE AVERAGE！ I ordered beef noodle which is like last night left over noodle without salt，totally no taste！！The bok coy in the noodle is yellow color，which means they are not new cooked！And the beef pancake is also no taste，it just tastes like eating pan fried bread. What more horrible is the lamb skewers have turned sour and stincky！！！They have gone bad. How can they sell this kind of food in the restaurant？？I just threw all of them in the trash can. Waste my money！！Never come back again！If I get diarrhea，that is totally their problem！\n",

Eating area: Cons: small and stuffy Pro: there's another door for waiting area and bathroom Food: would not come back. Maybe it's just not for me. Crispy chicken was really sweet, the dumplings weren't the typical dumplings we would have at a dim sum restaurant. Fried rice was hard. Chow fun was good, just more bean sprouts than noodles. Green beans was probably my favorite.\n",

      "The dumplings were very good, especially the soup dumplings. Be careful coming here around lunchtime though, the waits at all of the dumpling places can be extremely long, and this place is extremely small and cramped as well. There's a reason for people being willing to wait though. Everything on the menu looks fantastic and is reasonably priced for the city. If you are waiting outside be careful looking in the windows at other peoples' food, it's torturous.\n",

You just put down your name on a notepad right outside the door and wait for your name to be called.The location is relatively small as it only contains a couple of tables so be ready for a wait if it picks up. The waitress puts an emphasis on ordering once and that they won't take your order after your initial order.We ended up ordering a lot such as the soup dumplings, beef chow fun, spicy dumplings, onion pancakes, pork dumplings with napa cabbage and the pork dumplings with green chieves. Everything came slowly, but was really good. The onion pancakes were probably the best I've ever had. The beef chow fun was pretty average but then again this place is more known for their dumplings which were all delicious.\n",

      "Went to this place last week with my mom and boyfriend. I was not only sad but embarrassed. The first time we came here we loved this place so much that we wanted to share it with other people. Oh how I so regret that.  They sat us in a crammed corner and ignored us. We were a table of four and when we asked for forks they brought us two. When we asked for water they brought out one. Not even lying. When we asked for napkins we were ignored again. Asked again. Ignored. We asked 4 times before napkins were actually brought out. All the women working here were just rude. When they were asked for basic restaurant necessities like eating utensils, water, and napkins they would pretend not to hear you then stand in the back and laugh. And the man working there was just as bad. He came to the table asking us if we were ready to order and when we said yes he then turned directly around and started to take care of someone's to go order. Horrible.  If all this wasn't enough when we were ordering our food he was like you order this, you get that, like what the hell man? Why don't you let your customers order what they want instead of pushing them to order menu items just to get the bill higher. Just awful. Everyone here is rude and I'm just sad and embarrassed my mom had to witness that.\n",

      "This hole-in-the-wall dumpling place is pretty solid, but also has its downsides. It's really small, so there's usually a wait for lunch or dinner. The menu is pretty simple - it describes what is in every dumpling and that's it. I like this because it's not fluffy, but if you want pictures, then consult Yelp. You also have to order everything for the table at the beginning, there are no add-one after the food comes out. I guess it makes sense because there are always people waiting, but...I feel like it can also be accommodated if people want to order more. You're just bringing them more business.The dumplings are a solid option. For a party of 8, we ordered 48 dumplings and a couple of noodle dishes and appetizers. The dumplings were good. I liked the one with corn the most since it's unique and adds a sweet taste. The pan fried dumplings are also good because of the crunch. I liked the chow fun as well. If you're in the mood for dumplings, this is a solid option in the Sunset. It won't break the bank, and you can have a variety of options.\n",

      "Let me start of by saying that the dumplings were delicious and that is the ONLY reason I'm giving this place any stars.THE SERVICE WAS HORRENDOUS!!! The waitlist functionality is a joke, they might as well use a damn sign up list and cross out.The host guy was RUDE AS F*** and condescending.  What restaurant in their right mind would stop you from ordering more food?!?! At least he should have given us the warning when we first ordered that this was a final order.  He basically waved his hand in my face and said \"No more we busy\".  I'm Chinese and I get that some Chinese people can be rude but I hate that type of behavior; so embarrassing.His annoying condescending tone on top made this one of the worst customer service experience I have ever gotten even in a Chinese establishment!!\n"

      "Part if this is maybe Amazon's fault because they didn't send a driver to pickup the food until I called, but the restaurant broke multiple food safety regulations sending this food.I put in the order with a delivery window of 30 min to an hour.  Two hours later the food is still not here so I call Amazon and they tell me they never scheduled a driver to pick it up.  I specifically ask if they schedule on now will I get cold food or will it be made fresh and I'm told by the Amazon rep that they'll cancel the original order and when they put in the new order it will be remade and should be delivered in 30 minutes.  This seems suspicious so I ask again about it being remade and she says yes so I'm ok with it.  45 min later the food shows up.  It's cold not even room temperature, but cold.  To make matters worse it's obvious it's been in that bag for nearly 2 hours at this point because the cardboard containers have melted through and the half the  contents are spilled in the bag  I'm livid and this point.  I'm diabetic and my blood sugar is crashing.

      "I needed an afternoon snack before some late dinner plans. I had the pork and chives dumplings steamed and they were good and juicy. However, they only gave this hot sauce and black vinegar. It needed a little something, perhaps a savory soy sauce or something. my boyfriend likes the pork and corn dumplings which I found unique because not a lot of places I know makes dumplings with corn. I do not recommend the one piece beef pancake. It was a very oily thick brown fried dough wrapped around falling apart grounded meat tasting beef. It was very unappetizing, and the pancake came as a whole. Not something to easily enjoy without cutting.\n",

      "I personally enjoy this place more than Dumpling Kingdom down the street. This place is very tiny - maybe about 8 small tables and even less tables when it's combined for larger parties. I've came here in the past but decided to re-try this place since my bf and I were craving dumplings and did not have a good experience at Dumpling Kingdom last time. We got here around 8:30pm on Friday and only had to wait about 5 minutes. I'm sure the wait is usually much longer because I believe I waited about an hour the first time I came here on a weekend for lunch, so we got pretty lucky.We ordered the spicy dumplings - pork and cabbage, green onion pancake, corn and chicken dumplings, and shanghai soup dumplings (xiao long bao). Everything was really good and I really enjoyed the vingear/soy sauce dipping sauce - just the perfect amount of flavor and tangy-ness. The shanghai soup dumplings had a good amount of soup in it as well. Our total was about $28 which is not bad for the amount of food we ordered with leftovers. The service was OK, the food came out within a decent amount of time. The place is a bit cramped and not the cleanest looking - definitely a hole in the wall. I would recommend coming with a small party - this place isn't really meant for a big group. Can't wait to come back! *Drooling and craving this place as we speak*\n",

The service is prompt, in comparison to the other restaurants in town. Our dumplings were nice and warm, specially the ones with corn, so yummy! I recommend those! Having lived in Shanghai for three years, I would compare these to the dumplings from the local places in 徐家汇 that are ¥10. That are delicious!\n",

The food is really good. They are famous for their dumplings and the dumplings are very good. I believe they are all hand made and there is a separate store where you can buy all the dumplings frozen. I really like any dumplings with chives and their soup dumplings are good too. I think they had really good snow pea shoots as well. The only issue is that this place is a bit pricy considering how hole in the wall it is. If I remember correctly, the snow pea shoots were REALLY expansive. Also I don't think I would wait in line for this place because I hate lines. However, I am always happy to come when there is not a line.\n",

Our favorite by far was the spicy wontons.The service wasn't the greatest. Our waitress wanted us to order outside while we were waiting. We weren't 100% ready, so we asked if we could put in half our order. She was very hesitant but finally said it was fine. We were seated right after that and she came back demanding the rest of our order. If she had explained to us her reasoning for needing our order so promptly, we would have been more understanding but she didn't offer us any explanation. We also had to ask for napkins which seemed to annoy the waitress, and were only brought one paper one each.I will say that the owner (or what appeared to be) came around to everyone's tables near the end of our meal and he was very sweet and kind. The food was decent enough that I would maybe order again for takeout, but I probably won't be dining in given the service.\n",

      "Expect to wait because the interior of this place is pretty small. Because there's so much people, they take your orders while you're standing on the street. I understand that it is harder to take orders while people are seated as the waiter might block the small walkways, etc. So I let that go... I'm more interested in the food anyways. The first thing I noticed: this is literally your typical Chinese restaurant- place looks dirty, service isn't the best but the food looks good. We ordered the green onion pancake, pork dumplings with napa, pork dumplings with chives, garlic pea shoots, shanghai soup dumpling, beef stew soup noodle and a beef chowfun. Like mentioned before, the tables are super small so we barely fit all that food on our table. The dumplings were REALLY good!

They have a ipad device outside the door for you to sign up for the waiting list - thought that was efficient.After about 40 minutes, we were seated inside. We knew what we wanted so we ordered quickly. We ordered 3 orders of the shrimp and chive dumplings. The dumplings were good, but the reason why I'm giving 2 stars is because we waited 50 minutes to get our food (apart from our 40 min wait to be seated) and nobody ever came to us to apologize about the wait or even assure us what time we could expect our food.I'm probably going to give this place another chance, but I won't dine in.

I like dipping the dumplings into the string bean's sauce since I'm not too fond of the strong vinegar dip they provide. Try it out if you ever order both! The garlicy soy sauce goes so well with the dumplings. Everything else here is just very mediocre. Pan fried soup dumplings were not very flavorful and had thick skin. The potstickers were soggy. The radish cakes took the longest to come out. Came out when I finished all my food and it wasn't anything to rave about. The outside was flakey though.

We ordered the dumplings and chow fun which were super filling.The dumplings were pretty good, it really just tastes like any other dumpling though, there is nothing special about it and overall if you just want cheap dumplings, this is the place to go. The chow fun was super oily and didn't really have much taste to it, which was sad because I love chow fun. The service isn't that great, you have to ask multiple times for something because it can get busy with to go orders and theres only one person working.

Despite getting in line on Yelp and receiving an alert that our table was ready, we couldn't get anyone's attention inside, and when we did, we were told to wait outside. It was 40 degrees! We came back in to warm up after a bit, and we realized that the people who disregarded orders and waited inside got to skip the line, because they weren't checking to make sure they called the right names. It's tiny, and people kept coming in and out and leaving the door open. Lots of chaos. We were finally seated, but they wouldn't let us order for about 30 minutes, because two big groups were seated and it seemed like they didn't want to overwhelm the kitchen. We were told we couldn't have pan fried soup dumplings, and it seemed like the same thing - the kitchen was just too busy to want to cook some menu items. It's a tiny place, and they seem to do a lot of carryout/delivery business.That said, the steamed soup dumplings were great. The green beans were pretty good, and the steamed dumplings, non-soup edition, were pretty good too. Pork and cabbage was just ok, but I thought beef and carrot was really good. Pan fried dumplings were not available, either.The service went from mystifying to rude, depending on the staff member we were interacting with, but the dumplings were tasty enough that I'd definitely frequent Kingdom of Dumpling again, but ONLY via carryout or delivery.

I'm also a big fan of the appetizers, we often get the soy bean noodles and beef tendon. My only food compliant is that the soup of the noodle soups can be a bit salty !

They don't allow you to order 2nd time because there were more customers waiting.

We had no issues with the service, food was brought out pretty quickly. Chicken fried rice was too oily, shanghai soup dumplings were so over cooked--the wontons were hard and barely any soup left, the fried Shanghai soup dumplings had no soup and probably only a gram size of meat inside. The pork in our dumplings were bland. We also ordered beef noodle soup, with not enough beef! The best thing I had with no complaints was the spicy chicken dumplings, lots of flavor but not too spicy. Overall I probably won't be back here.\n",

      "This unfortunate restaurant has the honor of becoming my first bad review in yelp. So folks, buckle up your seatbelts for a scathing and unforgiving few paragraphs (kidding but seriously, get ready). The service:I usually don't comment on the service as they are usually the same or standard all around. And even if it is a Chinese restaurant (which are INFAMOUS for their bad service), that does not excuse bad service. (And no, a yelp review I read about this restaurant, a dirtier kitchen and crappier service is NOT equivalent to better food. What a hilariously ignorant thing to say.) I had the honor of choosing the restaurant to eat at this week and mistakenly chose this place. We had tried to wave down the wait staff for approximately 10 minutes (and if you've seen the teeny tiny size of this place. You literally cannot miss anyone unless you are blind.) Instead or tending to the guests, one of the wait staff picked up the phone, another one listened in on the phone call, and another was standing in front of the waitress writing something down. Either way, there was three of them on a phone call where there should only be one. But that is not all, they had decided HMMM PERHAPS WE SHOULD SQUEEZE 4 GROWN PEOPLE ON A TABLE FOR TWO. GOOD IDEA YES. Like ?????? It is acceptable if the place was packed.  But when a party of four left, PLEASE PLEASE MOVE US TO THE TABLE. We had just sat down and my anxiety a** could not handle ASKING YOU TO MOVE US. But perhaps that was on me and my fellow family members. But I would not base my review SOLOLY on the service. The food seemingly MATCHED THE POOR SERVICE AS WELL. DA RAVED ABOUT FOOD: First thing first. If this restaurant was not in SF or any place with real Chinese people and real Chinese food, it would righteously be a hit in the so unfortunate small town. But in San Francisco where almost everywhere you turn there is a chinese (but you couldn't seem to find a chinese person in this restaurant and now I know why), this is a shame on our name. The food was overall BLAND. TO THE CORE. If this is supposedly USA's Top 100 Chinese Restaurants, then there must be only 100 Chinese restaurants in America because there is NO WAY it has made the list. (Unless the food has rapidly changed.)1. Xiao Long Bao: worse than Kome's. And that's saying something. (2/5)2. Crispy Chicken Wings (or something like that): this was a new thing on their menu (or so they claim) and it was definitely new. Because the recipe for this must be half finished because it was bland. The sauce had a small SMALL hint of sweetness and then it quickly died. The chicken was just chicken. It as fine but... not good. 3. Chow Mein: 3/5 this was decent. It was average. It was normal.  But there was as much bean sprouts as there were noodles so if you don't like bean sprouts, beware. 4. Pork Dumplings with Corn (2/5) now I've never had corn in my dumplings and I've still never had it. Because if they put corn in that, I am shocked. 5. Soup noodles with Wonton (the thick noodles): 3/5 it is like the noodles you eat when you are sick. So it's bland (which is what I think it's supposed to taste like) and the soup itself is okay. The wontons are just... like I could buy frozen ones and keep them frozen and it would be better than this. 6. Beef pancake: 3/5. It's like an onion pancake but beef inside. Normal and would recommend as everything else on the menu is seemingly trash. Also, not a smart idea to have an open kitchen when I could see and count with my hands and toes and then need to borrow someone else's, the health violations being performed only 20 feet away. I love that.\n",

After asking they just started making them...

      "++MUST ORDER THE GARLIC GREEN BEANS! The green beans are super fresh and crunchy with lots of garlic sauce. I also ordered 2 orders of the XLB's. I really appreciate that the XLB's are soupy and not dried up here. Last thing we ordered was the Napa cabbage dumplings which were tasty as well.  I really like their orange chili sauce they have on the tables, gives your dumpling an extra kick. Minus one star-- I don't appreciate being told \"THAT IS ALL YOU ARE ORDERING?? THAT IS NOT ENOUGH.\" I came here around 1:30pm which means you don't know what I ate earlier. I might have had a huge breakfast for all you know, and you're going to assume that this isn't enough food?! Don't talk like this to your customers..The restaurant is very small and you can hear everyones business. When the waiters need to add chairs to the tables, they take the ones from outside, and since I was sitting by the door they would hit my chair when they removed or took a chair.  They do not say sorry here nor do I think they care. The food is good and I will be coming back. Just be prepared that the service may seem rude and the restaurant isn't the cleanest.\n",

My favorite dishes we ordered were the garlic green beans and the pork dumplings. The service here was excellent- the owner actually offered us food that he was eating for lunch and shook our hands after we paid for our meal. Next time I'm in San Francisco I will make sure to come back to Kingdom of Dumpling!\n",

      "I ate at this dump for the second time last night. To be fair, the last time I ate here, about four months ago, I thought the food was decent; nothing special, but solid. Something has changed because what we received last night was embarrassing. First, we were denied a larger table for our party of three, because they told us it was for \"four or more\". Fine. But 10 minutes later they seated a single man at that table. We were left sitting between two other tables, so close that we were literally wedged in place. A young man was at a neighboring table, munching away, obliviously playing music on his phone, treating everyone to his musical tastes, AND he had a dog sitting on the floor next to him.  In a restaurant. I love dogs, but that is not the place for them.  As to the food, we ordered xiao long bao, and the broth had almost no flavor at all. I requested water and was ignored. I asked a second time and was ignored. I finally walked into the kitchen and made the request to the entire staff, finally receiving it. Both chow mein with chicken and garlic green beans tased of burned oil. I suspect they reuse cooking oil for multiple dishes, which is disgusting. Both dishes left an acrid aftertaste. Last but not least, barely, was five spice beef, a cold appetizer that was okay, but not better than that. Service was just bad, inattentive, borderline rude, and inept. Even if I were eating for free I would not return here.\n",

Tiny place was a bit nervous we would wait forever, however they made it work, dumplings were all AMAZING!!! Could not keep myself from shoving more into my mouth! They make me feel so happy! So much I couldn't resist and went back there a few days later for more! This time during the week around 2pm so no waiting. My favorite ones were the Spicy Wontons and Spicy Dumplings, can't even begin to describe how yummy they were and how happy I was eating them :-)\n",

      "This is a very small restaurant, always with a line of people waiting outside. Is it really that good here? Short answer: yes!When my girlfriend and I got to sit down after a ~10 minute wait, we ordered 1 order of the pork dumpling with napa cabbage, and 2 orders of Shanghai soup dumplings. The waitress kind of laughed at us, saying it's probably not enough food for the two of us and suggested a few other dishes to order. Even though we ordered 24 dumplings, we gave in and got the garlic string beans too.The food came out promptly one at a time:Pork dumpling with napa cabbage - pretty good. Plump little dumplings. I liked putting a tiny bit of the chili sauce on top and popping it in my mouth.Shanghai soup dumplings - delicious! Make sure not to eat the entire dumpling in one bite, as the soup inside is very hot! Glad we got 2 orders of this.Garlic string beans - very good! Lots of garlic! We were glad we chose this dish when the waitress suggested us to order more.The only thing I don't like is how this restaurant is pretty run down and old. The plates had cracks and chips on them. The teapot wobbled when set down on the flat table. The chopsticks weren't straight.But overall, the food was delicious enough to make me want to come back next time, and the fact that they accept credit cards is a plus!\n",

      "A fried of mine invited me out to this place, and part of me begrudgingly went because I hate traveling into the city from the East Bay.  Let me begin by saying that I love this dingy and cramped Mom and Pop vibe of this restaurant.  With giants like Din Tai Fung and other corporate eateries, it's nice to know that you have places like this still dishing out quality food.  I let my friend take a lead, and he orders the Chicken chow mein, the XLB's, pork and cabbage dumplings and string beans.  I usually judge a Chinese place by its chili oil and to my dismay they didn't have it (or at least on the table).  But my friend reassured me that their spicy sauce, albeit it drastically different than the familiar chili oil, was tasty.  And so I exuberantly pour it on my food and he's just staring at me, aghast.  He says that the sauce is super spicy.  I laugh.  I can handle spicy.  As I put it in my mouth, the spice coat my entire mouth, and boy, does it have a nice kick to it.  I like the homey feels of this place.  I'd definitely come again, but next time with less spicy sauce on my dumplings.\n",

      "Overall a very poor experience, exacerbated by what several others, who patroned this location, have observed.There was at least a 45 minute wait before being seated, which was OK for my group. We did not mind, given that the reviews stated the food quality at this location was great.However, after being seated, we did not receive prompt service. We had to flag the waiter several times in order to begin ordering. We were about to leave since we were getting fed up. We noticed - the waiter gave preferential treatment to non-Chinese visitors, in particular, those of Caucasian descent. We were seated first, however priority service was given to others while we waited in frustration. Initially, I dismissed this observation, thinking that we were coming to such conclusions too quickly. Until -The boss of this location proceeded to give free creme brulees to all patrons in this location to make up for the very long wait times as a service recovery method. However - all tables around us were seated with at least one non-Chinese descent patron. All tables around us were given a free creme brulee; we were purposefully ignored as we did not have non-Chinese customer in our group.Several others who visited this location have also experienced the same sentiment. A clear preferential treatment given to \"foreigners\" - 外國人 - or those of non-Chinese descent. I will share this experience with my Chinese family members and friends. This location is a disgrace.1 Star review, not subject to change.只給一星 ; review改不了\n",

Being a city guy (nyc, chi, etc.) I don't expect 5 star service with hustle and bustle shops but king of dumpling ranks highly low for even my tremendously low standards. 4 stars because I don't particularly mind (I almost understand -- it's super busy) but they take it a bit lower than low. Still worth it for the fix. They have amazing shanghai soup dumplings and if you call in advance for take out it's usually 30 min which isn't too bad.I wouldn't recommend dining in but they aren't awful -- just swamped.

      "Dumplings were decent, but not amazing. Small restuarant and average price for dumplings. I ordered the Shanghai dumplings, regular pork and chive dumplings, and beef pancakes. The shanghai dumpling had soup in it, but the flavor was only okay without sauce. Needed to dip it into the vinegar and chili sauce to enhance the flavor. Pork and chive dumplings were good for what they were and they can fill you up more. The beef pancake on the other hand was way to oily (A puddle of oil on the plate under the pancakes...oily). I couldn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked.Service was fast and the waitresses were a little bit too pushy because of the people waiting.  Good for one try, but probably won't be coming back here.\n",

      "Kingdom of Dumpling is below average in every way from ambiance and service and featuring namesake dumplings with too-thick wrappers with oddly diminished flavors.\"Kingdom of Dumpling\"?I'd call it \"Dim sum on a plot of land.\" Not a suburb and definitely not a kingdom.The table was slightly sticky with an uncovered condiment jar that after two servers repeatedly walked by I handed to a sulky waitress with a polite smile. No one bothered to wipe the table; it was acceptable I guess in an equivalent of a Cantonese greasy spoon. The place is a hole-in the wall but many great meals can be had in shopworn mom & pop spots so I wasn't deterred per se -but I also kept in mind that Dumpling Kitchen just up the street is closed on Wednesdays and I had two hungry kids in tow. But the beef chow fun was so forgettable (heck, I'm Irish and can rock this dish that would *shame them - and I've only made it three times).I braced myself as more plates came out of the kitchen in quick succession.Both XLB  (6 to an order) and chicken and corn dumplings (I believe there were 12) had awful, thick and sticky wrappers like they'd been steamed and sat there then maybe dunked in a finishing pot of boiling water. Of course the kids liked the XLB because they're fun- there's soup in them- and my little boy got to be the boss and show his friend how to eat them so I got a second order.I had to ask for spoons for the XLB. They were brought out testily as if mine was a special request. The chicken wings, meh. The string beans were solid, the only high point.Since the servers aren't responsible for the food, I tipped 21%, despite the snippiness, and said \"goodbye' in Cantonese.....and I got nothin'.  Indifferent service in a small space with no ventilation and really mediocre food, especially their dumplings- tell me how this place garners a line out the door and a table is \"worth waiting for\"?I can't in good conscience bump this review to 3 stars: Total pass.\n",

      "As a result of a Check Please we went there with a Chinese friend who lives nearby on 27th Avenue. Three of us were to get right in and sit down and order all at the same time with the waitress who was anxious to get moving.  I compare the experience with my usual German Sausage experience.  One of the Wurst.      The place looked great on t.v. Inside its a dump. To make matters worse, two doors away is a converted garage with tables, a drink refrigerator and a wall mounted t.v.  If you are in the main 'salon', and want to use the restroom, you have to leave the premises and go to the annex to do number #1, number #2 and maybe #3.      I cannot stress enough here that this is a place for teen-agers to frequent and little else.    The food: We had a large order of dumplings, assorted soups and something unmentionable. Now I hate the sprig of parsley in places like Denny's on your breakfast platter but I would have given extra for a tiny spring on the order of 12 dumplings. They are steamed and not pan-fried like gyoza. The order came on a plate and looked like something from a high school biology experiment. They were truly unappetizing and that is where the parsley would have had some redemption value.  Service is fast but sloppy. The tables are tiny and the customers large. Go there, if you challenge my opinion. If you agree and trust me, go elsewhere.\n",

      "Why is parking such a major hassle in Parkside? I was circling and circling on those lookalike residential blocks hoping a space would open up, but no, I was constantly fooled by those little three-quarter spaces between the driveways. Alas, I finally found a place to park four blocks away from the restaurant, and Jamie W. and I were fighting the biting evening cold walking to this cramped spot. You can imagine our disappointment in having to sign a waiting list and sitting on a bench outside for our table to be ready.Indeed it was ten minutes later, but you had to squeeze between chairs, strollers and waitresses to get to it. We didn't waste time ordering as we started with the $7.95 Garlic String Beans which were wok-fried and thoroughly blistered the way I like 'em (photo: bit.ly/2nYMAFs). They were tasty if a tad oily. Jamie must have been in a takeout mood because he ordered the $7.95 XO Chicken Chow Mein which turned out to be a hefty portion of thick noodles mixed with the standard vegetables and again heavy on the greasy side (photo: bit.ly/2ogwHN2).I went with one of the specials way above my head on the whiteboard, the $13.95 Rack of Lamb with Rice. It wasn't a rack like Jayne Mansfield has a rack. It was three grilled lamb chops. The plate came with a bowl of rice, a dipping soy sauce, and three lonely asparagus spears - their idea of a gourmet dinner (photo: bit.ly/2oo5qsB). I was hoping for a little more lamb and a lot less salt but that's probably the best they can do for the price. Now you can't come to the Kingdom of Dumpling without ordering dumplings.In order to fulfill our mission, we first ordered the $4.95 Shanghai Soup Dumplings because that's our litmus test for true dim sum and as expected, got a half-dozen in a basket (photo: bit.ly/2oQ5NwQ). They were just OK with a couple bereft of any broth inside. That was a bummer, and they certainly don't provide any worthy competition for Din Tai Fung. We ended our meal with the $5.95 Pork Pot Stickers (photo: bit.ly/2oWMO0t), which were steaming hot, hearty, and finally satisfying after all.

      "I ended up here by accident. When my friend said the dumpling house on Taraval, I knew this was the one that was closest to her house. What I didn't know was just how many dumpling houses there are on Taraval. I counted at least three within a four or five block radius. This one is small and unassuming, bordering on basic. I think they have about 8 tables. All of which were full during our lunch. The tables are close and it gets noisy, but you are still able to have a decent conversation if you want. They have an extensive menu, so it's good for sharing. It's not good for a long, lingering anything. Because it's small, and people seem intent on eating and moving on, this is not a place to linger. We did, but if I were to go here again, this would not be the place I would pick. Again, it's small. I don't think they even have a restroom. However, it seemed pretty clean. And I liked the fact that the staff sat down for a group lunch towards the end of our visit. Seeing staff eat the food always makes me more confident in my choice of eating establishment. There are many reasons why that might be a crazy notion, but it works for me. So, based on all the other reviews, you must be wondering about the service. Well, they were fast. The food was hot. they kept the tea flowing. Based on what I already told you, you might suspect that is as good as it gets. It is, but I'm not sure what people expect. Not every place is going to be a five star, white glove affair. I think people go here to eat good food at a reasonable price. Anything else they get is just gravy. Go for a wide selection of yummy dumplings. This is NOT a go to destination, but it is wonderful if you happen to be in the neighborhood. It's a solid 3.5 stars.\n",

      "Seriously, all the great dumpling restaurants in the Bay Area have really big egos compared to the space of the actual seating area. However, after being chatted up by the extremely enthusiastic owner (who claimed that his dumplings were THE BEST!) during my 30-minute wait, I was ready to devour a kingdom of dumplings. [Food]I had the Pork and Napa Cabbage, Chive and Shrimp and Pork Dumpling, Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings, and the pan fried shanghai dumplings. Everything was amazing. I am a self-proclaimed queen of soup dumplings and really judge my XLB hard, but these were some of the juiciest I've had in San Francisco. I highly recommend ordering the boiled dumplings. I normally get the Pork and Napa Cabbage, but these were savory and perfectly cooked. I also ordered a classic sweet soybean milk to finish off the meal. My ideal meal of Chinese food. [Service]It's your classic Chinese restaurant. The owner has the line on rotation, and has perfected the timing of the experience. He takes your order before you sit down during the long wait process, but the moment you sit down, the dumplings magically appear before your eyes. You'll probably be in and out within 30 minutes (longer than your wait time to enter the small space). If you have the time and can make it out to Sunset, definitely come to Kingdom of Dumpling. You won't regret it!\n",

And, they will always be amazing. In same vein, 90% of the menu is over-priced filler.Ordered string beans (over-fried, over salted, nothing special about taste), Beef tendon soup (highlight of meal; perfectly seasoned. Tendon had been well cleaned and prepared, so no stinky-winky-funky smells; perfect texture; smattering of greens, and good texture noodles), Tsing Tao (arrived promptly), Lamb Dumplings (never arrived), fish balls in curry (could have been good, but overly sweetened; I hate to say it, but seemed overly americanized for the snickers-loving palate) and spicy wings (not spicy at all, but even sweeter than the fish-balls). The wings were so sticky with sweetness that I did even want to touch the plate, let alone the wings (health hazard!). IF I had time to kill, would go back for the beef tendon soup, and, taste whatever others ordered to figure out next go-to dish.0 for service operations: Ordered lamb dumplings. Got all the other food, finished eating. Asked the waitress if dumplings were coming. She peeked into kitchen, and assured me they were on their way. After a little bit of a wait, I asked for check, gave my credit card and said - if dumplings are not ready, please kill the order. maî·tre d confirmed. When bill came, turned out they not only did not give me the dumplings, but charged me for it. Then I asked it be taken off. Took them 10 mins to execute transaction. But, reduction was less than the price they charged! 4 for service by wait staff: Other than the kerfuffle with the lamb dumplings, the staff were prompt and responsive. Also, I really did not like the fact that they take your order before you are seated. Generally, while you are standing outside, waiting for a table.\n",

      "I have mixed feelings about this place. I go here A LOT, but after my last dining experience you probably won't catch me here anymore.My boyfriend and I love the food here knowing they're not very sanitary. Basically the last time I went (the owner was not there), the service was worse than usual and I witnessed some stuff I wish I didn't see. One of the 3 waitresses stood behind my boyfriend and was popping her pimple in front of the mirror.. Customers came in and she used the same hands to serve them.Towards the end of our meal I watched as one of the kitchen ladies stood in the dining area and picked her nose. I can't..... The rest of my meal tasted extra salty for some reason.....\n",

      "Food:  ordered a number of dishes.  Soup dumplings were delicious.  The wrap was strong enough to hold the juice and meat.  Juice was tasty.  Other dishes included the pot stickers, onion pancake, pickled cucumber, pan fried soup dumplings, and dumplings with chive.  Pot stickers were delicious too.  Nice crisp on both the pot stickers and the fried soup dumpling.  The fried soup dumpling felt more of a meat bun since the dough was a bit thicker.  The dumpling with chives were tasty too.  Good size dumplings.  The fried items do take a little longer than the rest.  So you'll have to be patient as the other food comes out quicker.Environment:  the restaurant is small.  They have a wait list on the outside of the restaurant for you to put your part name and size.  The staff is friendly and the restaurant owner was very kind as he walked around to check on the diners.  Overall: I would definitely return.  Good food and especially at a reasonable price.  $60 for 4 people.\n",

      "A friend took me here after we had a pretty subpar experience at another Shanghai Dumpling spot in the city.Came here HUNGRY. We ordered 3 orders of the XLB Dumplings, Beef Chow Fun, and Garlic Green Beans.Green Beans we're pretty good! Sauce was tasty and the beans seemed pretty fresh.Beef Chow Fun was good, though I rarely have a bad chow fun encounter since it's pretty simple.The XLB dumplings were the star of the show. Literally so amazing, I would go back there and eat just those dumplings everyday. They had a ton of soup, which was my favorite part. And the dumpling skin was perfect - not too thick but thick enough to hold the soup in.I dream of these dumplings daily - you gotta try them!!\n",

      "The food is not bad and it's rare to find mainland Chinese food in San Francisco, but the service stereotypically for Chinese restaurants is bad.  I live nearby and yesterday what was insulting to me was not only did the server take the person that came AFTER me's order first when I was damn right ready to order before him, but the server didn't bring out two of my orders (one being a cold dish), which I believe she completely forgot them because I was done eating the hot items and full already after a lot of time had passed.  I then tell them we didn't get our food and to cancel my other two orders, but she tries to be sneaky and tell the food prep or cooks to hurry up and bring out my dishes. I wasn't having that and I said no I want to cancel those two, but she said I can only cancel one. Well, that's fine because since you don't wanna cancel my dishes because you messed up, then it comes out of your tip. For a $42.40 bill, left them $43. Enjoy your .60 cent tip.  I'm not coming back for a long time and will enjoy eating mainland Chinese food at house of pancakes instead up near 19th ave.\n",

      "I have been going to this restaurant for almost 8-9 years now since it's on walking distance from my place. I have recommended and have taken so many of my friends and coworkers there this whole time. Food has always been good and cheap there so their service never bothered me much but today to accommodate new customers they were pushing us out. We had literally been there only for 15 minutes at this point and they started rushing us. They even pointed to the group that came in that they could stand right next to our table and order and as soon as we finish they can have that table. I am never going back there ever! Didn't even get to finish our dinner and we just left. Very disappointed\n",

      "This is the worst service I've ever experienced. Completely unacceptable in 2018. The owner (person taking the orders) deserves no respect at all as he has failed to show any. We are polite and as he takes our orders, he passive aggressively forces us to order certain things. We wanted the green chives pancakes but he says no as it takes 30-35 minutes. It's a busy night so I understand and politely order something else. He then takes the order of another party not more than five feet away and they order the same thing, the green chives pancakes, but he agrees. If that's not a spit in my face, I don't know what is. I confront him, still very polite at this point. I ask why can that party order the green chives pancakes and not me. His response, \"let me think about it.\" Disgusting excuse of a person. I just say no I'm not eating here and leave. I would have loved to yell in his face. Now, reading other comments, this pathetic excuse of a man is actually biased against Chinese patrons.  It all makes sense now since the other party was non-Chinese. What a disgusting business. DO NOT EAT HERE. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS. They do not deserve an ounce of respect. I'm so glad I did not give them my business and I will make sure to tell EVERYONE I KNOW TO NOT EAT HERE.I WILL ACTIVELY AND GO OUT OF MY WAY TO TELL PEOPLE TO NOT EAT HERE. Screw you, dumb business owner.\n",

      "We ordered an onion pancake, chicken dumplings and string beans. Onion pancakes were lightly crunchy and mildly flavoured; not spicy, a hint of pleasant salt along with a red sriracha sauce. The sauce was spicy-hot but went along well with the pancakes. Chicken dumplings were as expected; a bit juicy, gooey and the chicken was mellow and well cooked. Again, it went well with the sriracha sauce. I would suggest going for string beans irrespective of what you order. They go well with whatever you order and this is after having food at Kingdom of Dumpling for at least five-seven times. They come with a base of a tingy saline and sugary sauce. Overall the food is good, worth experimenting if your taste buds are open to exciting and novelty food. Service is average, usually need to follow up on orders following the first one. Example, I remember asking for a coke, but didn't get one till the very end. Overall the food was delicious and we had a scrumptious meal. PS: they serve a complimentary green tea which is refreshing.\n",

      "It was good fortune that brought us here. And how grateful I am.My husband and I were in the bay area and we had originally planned to have lunch at SanTung on Christmas morning.  To me, it was the only visit-worthy restaurant on our short trip up north that would be open on Christmas day.  But to our disappointment, when we drove to SanTung, they were closed! So after a quick search on Yelp and a phone call to Kingdom of Dumpling, our plans were changed.  When we arrived, there was no wait.  We were seated right away, which is surprising considering the many reviews and accolades that this place has received and also the small size of this restaurant.  How fortunate we were.  I didn't have much time to prepare myself on what I would order.  After all, this restaurant was a last minute decision and there was no wait time to see what others were ordering.  I had to trust my fellow Yelpers:* XLB (shanghai soup dumplings)* pan fried XLB (shanghai pan fried soup dumplings)* XO Beef ChowFun* Green Beans* Pork & Shrimp wonton with wide rice noodle soupEach dish was delicious.  And without a doubt, probably the best XLB I've ever had anywhere. In addition, their orange colored hot sauce is a beautiful mystery of its own.  I put that sauce on my dumplings, on my xo noodles, in the soup... it was outrageously addicting. I regret not ordering their non XLB dumplings or their Green Chives pancake. As I sat there eating my food, I noticed that these were also probably some of their staple items that I didn't get a chance to order.   By the time I looked up from my plate to notice the tables around me, I was already getting full. I am so glad that SanTung was closed on Christmas because it led us here. I will definitely be coming back for more.\n",

      "Small place, great taste. Usually a wait if you go during normal dinner and lunch hours. The dumplings are house-made and flavorful and have a good skin thickness to meat ratio (pretty balanced). Sauce isn't 100% soysauce and/or vinegar thank god. Dumplings are 100. And although they have a wide variety of foods on the menu, I'd say most of them are pretty standard and not extraordinary.Their beef pancake is a little disappointing in that it's very greasy and the pancake isn't the usual chewy scallion pancakes I'm used to, rather it's some type of fried, dense, dough? Maybe a regional nuance but the beef is also ground but I was expecting tender beef slices (ok I'm probably thinking of Taiwanese beef rolls which aren't pancakes but that's what I wanted). I also had their beef noodle bowl which was alright. Towards the end the noodles started tasting like salt and I couldn't finish it--especially since there was too many noodles for the toppings that came with it. Will return for more dumplings!\n",

Something must have happened from transferring to the container because there's no soup in the container, either.

He said the pork and green onion dumpling was the most popular.  I love green onion...As a seasoning. I'm not kidding you - I could still taste the onion hours later. It was more like a green onion dumpling with a tiny amount of pork as seasoning. Needless to say- we didn't finish either of the dumplings.\n",

      "If I was as into yelp 6-7 years ago, I would give this place full 5 stars, but because I am more into yelp now, I give it 2.5-3 stars. THENThe food is always good, came in big portions and cooked to perfection. Always got our food in a timely manner. The service was wonderful for a hike in the wall. NOWIt's so disappointing. I have always ordered the xo beef chow fun, pork and corn dumpling, the beef pancakes and green beans. The xo beef chow fun is still good, but the portion got totally cut. The beef pancakes were undercooked. The skin on the inside was soggy and mushy. Everything else was the same and taste the same, which is why I still give the food 4.5-5. But the service...it's horrible. Constantly had to wave someone down to try and order and they would just look at me and then pretended they didn't see me. Waited 15-20 mins to be able to wave someone down to get the check. Once again wave at a few other workers only to have them look at me and walk away. Like cmon guys! I know you see me! The store ain't that big, so why walk away when you're literally just a few steps away. You can't even play it off that you're avoiding me. I noticed that they started doing the delivering services (Grubhub, Uber eats, and etc.). I feel as if everyone was so busy because they were trying to tend to the orders instead of the people that were actually there. They are so focused on getting the food out for delivery that they forget the darn people sitting at the restaurant. They ignore them and avoid them. Overall, It was such an annoying experience, I don't think I would go back to eat there. Even if the food is good. Maybe I'll just order to go since it seems like people getting food delivered gets them faster anyways.\n",

My friend ordered a soda and they didn't bring it until the dumplings came. For a small restaurant with 3-4 waitresses, I usually expect better service but who knows, maybe they were having issues in the kitchen to cause this. So if you're not super hungry and want decent food in the sunset then this is your place!\n",

It's perfect for a little date night dinner - there aren't many tables so plan for a wait time during meal hours. We waited no more than 30 minutes - during this time we were able to look at the menu and choose our food. Our order was taken while we were waiting outside and seated shortly after.For 2 people we ordered the garlic string bean, pork dumpling with chives, 12 count; chicken dumpling with napa cabbage, 12 count; beef dumpling with carrots, 12 count; Shanghai soup dumpling - Xiao long bao for those of you unfamiliar ;), 6 count; and Shanghai pan fried soup dumpling. Each plate was made fresh and served hot so keep that in mind before you bite into one.The service was great and they checked up on us for when our other dumplings were coming out.

However, as pointed out by numerous reviews, the establishment is out right racist, and has a history of discriminatory practices. Caucasian guests are seated before Asian guests regardless of the wait list, and Asian guests are often denied certain orders and basically service for no reason, other than to provide better service to non-asian guests. Go through the review history, this has apparently been an issue recently. Management was not always like this, and as a neighbor, I used to frequent this restaurant quite often.Avoid it like the plague, there's no place for racism in 2019.\n",

It's really good and comes out quick. My boyfriend and I finished it before the rest of our orders came out. Chives pancake: This is a deconstructed version of the chives pancake I usually get. Instead of a pancake, it's more like an empanada. Radish cake: It's not really a cake, but more like a mochi ball. The outside is flaky, and the radish inside is hot and dense. My boyfriend loved this.Hot tea is served to your table when you are seated. It was pretty watered down, but very very hot. --SERVICE-- Abysmal Lol. I never got my water. We ordered the soup dumplings and we didn't get it at all. They even charged us for it, but we corrected it and had it taken off. I was MAJORLY BUMMED. I mean, it's Kingdom of Dumpling... I wanted dumplings.. )=Also, you have to order everything you want when your waitress comes. If you want to order more midway through your meal, they won't take it.Your orders will come out one by one, and sometimes it'll be a long while in between each other.

I keep passing by it when I am on the L-Taraval line but eventually I gave in and paid it a visit. It's not as glamorous as how people see it on TV but actually really worth the price. It costs less than Din Tai Fung and it's a good diversion from the overpriced food on the other side of SF and parking is not an issue here. There are plenty of spots nearby for all sorts of vehicles. I tried the lamb dumpling and it tastes good. Normally I make my own XLB or dumplings but if there's some random ingredient I can't do then this place does the trick. They even have other nice dishes that you can get here. Also a good place for a family dinner too. Drawback: it can be real noisy here so please keep that in mind. The food here is no stranger to me so that too is generic. Don't get your hopes up if you are a Chinese food fanatic, it's mostly locals and tourists here. If you love good food go somewhere else\n",

      "Craving Sunday dumplings and headed over to my usual go to place for dumplings, dumpling kitchen....only to find out to my horror that it is closed!!! Apparently the owners retired after many years of serving delicious dumplings and Asian small dishes. Luckily a similar dumpling place was nearby-kingdom dumpling! I've never been but decided to give it a try.  There was a bit of a line despite it being 2pm-good sign!!  They are very efficient and took ppls orders before they were seated to help expedite the turn-over. Smart! Our party of 4 decided to order 2 sets of soup dumplings (6 in each set), fried onion pancake, beef pancake (basically fried onion pancake stuffed with sautéed beef), and 2 orders of steamed dumplings (pork with Napa cabbage and pork with chives- 12 to each order). We then tried to order Shanghai style pan fried dumplings- but the man taking orders waved his hand at us and shook his head.  No more? I asked. No you order 2 fried items already- too many fried items. Huh?!?  I was confused. That's ok I said- I want to order the pan fried dumplings. He said no, only 2 fried items allowed. What?!? That's weird. So to clarify I asked: so I cannot order the pan fried dumplings? No too many fried items. Uhhhh. Ok nvm then. Strike 1. We are seated and they bring over the dishes and cups. There was soy sauce stains all over my plate and all over the tea pot. Strike 2. The food came and the soup dumplings were actually quite delicious- with skin not too thick and not too thin. The broth in the dumplings was quite flavorful. The steamed dumplings were ok. Standard fare nothing special. Then came the fried onion pancakes, which are my favorite. This one had a good crisp, but not too flakey. However 2 bites in I lost my appetite when I saw to curly pieces of hair stuck on my pancake. It looks like it was stuck in the batter so took a little effort to pull out. Ugh lost my appetite. Strike 3. I tried to like this place but from the bad experience, the issue with cleanliness and the 2 pieces of hair, we won't be coming back.\n",

Bonus: he takes your order while you are in line so by the time you sit down, your food arrives shortly thereafter!Try the Xiao Long Bao, Green Chive Pancake (more stuffing than the green onion version), Shrimp and Chive dumpling , Farmers cucumber,Tofu bean noodles, and the crispy sauté green beans.

We ordered a dozen shrimp chives, a dozen chicken napa, six XLB, and a plate of veggies. Perfectly plump and moist, these dumplings are the ideal size and texture for an eating contest. Dipped in some garlic black vinegar mmMMmm MMM!! Ate so much that I got a belly ache afterwards, but can't help it, I love me some legit dumplings.The veggies are simple garlic and salt stirfry, but its how I would cook it at home. HUGE plate. Enough green vitamins for a week. The XLB... well I've definitely had better. But its not really what I came for so I wasn't that disappointed. Customer service here is ... interesting. Being from north China myself, I know how sometimes the way we speak and act is normal in China but can be interpreted as rude in the US. But the staff here is... trying too hard? I noticed they brought out a chair outdoors so someone with a kid could have a seat, and that they gave some quarters to the meter maid so their customer indoors didn't have to worry about it. The waiter came to check if we were doing OK, and tried to be friendly by lightly tapping us on the shoulder to tell us goodbye... but everything seemed forced or very non-Chinese or had some ulterior motive (eg more tips).

I had my daughter check to see if anyone was leaving after 30 minutes. Yes, someone was paying. I didn't get a notification, and next thing you know, they gave our table away. I went in and asked if they were using their wait list. The waitress scowls and yells at me and says \"outside, outside.\" Well, apparently, there is another paper wait list hanging to the left of the door high up in the dark. Why 2 wait list?! I asked the man why he asked me to sign up on the yelp wait list if they are not using it. He just ignored me and went back into the kitchen.Good food does not justify rudeness.By the way, there are 2 other good dumpling places up on Taraval st-House of Pancake and Shangdong Deluxe.\n",

      "I have recently had a couple of meals from Kingdom of Dumpling and am a fan. We ordered takeout - where the delivery estimate was 85 minutes but it took 60 minutes- and we enjoyed the meal.  We had shrimp with chives dumplings (tasty), chicken with Chinese spinach dumplings (a bit dry- not my fave), chicken Lo Mein (greasy but noodles were so good and moist), pork pot stickers (didn't try), golden mushrooms (enoki with cucumbers- good), and green beans (excellent/ though super greasy).  Last week, we were at a holiday party where they had pans of 6 different kinds of dumplings (I liked the vegetarian and the chicken with corn), the beef pancake, noodles, green beans and others.  We all thought the food was great and it was perfect for a party with kids and adults.  They made sure the dumplings were kept heated in big catering pans.  Been to the restaurant only once - it's small and there was a very long wait.  Hard to eat a large variety unless you have a group, so I think the delivery option is definitely the way to go!\n",

      "After a huge craving of dim sum, I managed to plan a dim sum date over the weekend! I wanted a million things, but the top ones were xiao long bao and green onion pancake. He wanted fried salt & pepper tofu and the beef tendon stew. Everything was awesome!Tofu was simply good though it relies on sauce for flavors. I wished that it had minced garlic, more salt, and a crispier exterior. Tasty with the spicy orange sauce they have at the table. The green onion pancake was buttery, tortilla-like. Something I could continue to munch on, but also relied heavily on sauce. The beef tendon stew was an unexpected favorite. Few pieces of meat (actually more fat than meat), but it was still very flavorful! Very strong flavors in the broth, savory from the shitaake mushroom pieces and from the brisket tendons. The noodles went well with it and the entire bowl was honestly just worth every dollar.The xiao long bao came out last. It was my most anticipated dish and while it creamily savory, I wanted more of a beefy savory similar to the beef tendon soup, but it had a stronger pork flavor. Enjoyable meal! Would love to go back for more.\n",

      "Was rolling 10 deep late one night in SF and needed to find a place to eat that catered to everybody's palate. Chinese food was the best bet. We turned to yelp for help and a few dumpling houses popped up. It took us 2 tries until we settled with kingdom-- it was open late and wasn't super busy. First things first, this place is NOT for big groups. This place is definitely a small hole in the wall type restaurant. The max capacity was prolly about 20-25? Cramped space with only about 6-8 small tables...so it took a while for us to be seated (approx. 20-25 min wait?). We had to split up into 2 groups which was okay, not a problem. They have a \"sign-in\" board and a menu outside for people to decide on what they wanted before being seated, which was helpful.My friends and I ordered the 2 plates of chow fun, pork/shrimp wonton soup, pork dumplings, shanghai soup dumplings and their garlic bok choy. And that was for 4 girls to share :P My fave was of course the chow fun and the shanghai soup dumplings. All the others were good, too. No complaints. We were satisfied with our orders. Service on the other hand was ehh alright. The waitress would ask if we were ready then leave and the guy which I presume was the owner or manager would then take our order then would get distracted. But he did check up on us after we received our dishes. Overall, dishes were reasonable priced and the food was good. Service was meh. They do have a bathroom but you have to walk through the kitchen and to the back to use it. It's dirty..only go if you really need to go :P\n",

      "Don't spend your time or money here. Service was horrible. I understand that Asian restaurants have a rep for \"bad service\" (which I've experienced), but this was another level. The service was straight up rude. We were told by the male waiter that we couldn't order food after we put our initial order in because they'll be too busy. He said we weren't ordering enough food and kept pushing over dishes for us to eat. After ordering, the waitstaff made us switch tables. So we're not allowed to order more afterwards, scolded for not ordering enough, then made us move after ordering. So over it. For 3 people, we ordered the bean paste noodles, pork & chive dumplings, XLB, chicken wings, and the green chives pancake (this was more than enough food btw, the waiter kept telling us to order more though). They get 1 star for XLB. It was pretty good. The other stuff was alright.\n",

      "I'll start with the cons, since they're something that you need to keep in mind to fully enjoy the food. The shop is small, so be ready to squish your party! That also means be ready to wait. When I found this place a couple years ago, the wait went up to nearly an hour, but it hasn't been that bad as of late. The service REALLY depends on who's working. There used to be (?) an older man whose priority is to get people in and out. So don't expect great service when their priority is to get sales.With that in mind... these are damn good dumplings. Honestly one of the best dumplings for the prince point and casual environment. I've tried other items too, chow mein, green beans, eggplant, beef and onion pancakes - all so good! And that sauce!!! It looks like La Vics, but perfectly suited for literally anything on the menu. Creamy, spicy, and tangy. We've tried to buy their sauce before, but they don't sell it!If you're gonna complain about parking, welcome to SF. This is the Sunset, so it's not even as bad as the rest of the city. Drop off one party member to get your name on the list, and expect the worst for parking. It'll make the experience better.\n",

      "Want mediocre food with even worse service? Well if you do, this is the place for you! Ordered shrimp and pork wonton with wide rice noodle, but they were out so we got egg noodle instead. We stood inside after we ordered, but they shouted at us to wait outside. Normally I wouldn't mind, but the weather was as cold as the hearts of the employees. They then proceeded to tell us that it would be a 30 minute wait for food and, after asking for a refund, the worker told us we are able to stay in a waiting room until our food came out. The noodles were very bland and so was the broth. The two dumplings that came inside the soup were good, but did not make up for the terrible service or rest of the other food.\n",

      "We've been here before, but don't frequent this restaurant because the food isn't that good. Sadly, our go-to dumpling restaurant a few blocks down closed and we had a huge dumpling craving so decided to give this place another try. We ordered a few items and said we'd like to order more and asked if we could keep the menu and order more in a few minutes. No. Not possible. The guy pulled the menu out of my hand and walked away. A minute or so later, he came out and yelled to the entire restaurant that the kitchen staff was going to take a lunch break and it would be a while.I'm cool with people having lunch and breaks, but that's something we should have heard before we ordered, not after. Or, make it official and close the restaurant for a little while. Don't make paying customers sit around and wait. We would have ordered and eaten more but were over this place so we paid and left after the few dishes we ordered came out.\n",

      "The worst restaurant hands down in all of San Francisco. I swear they must have paid someone to write their review on a foodie blog (which is how I found their place and therefore decided to try it out). The dumplings were not cooked properly and clearly made from frozen stock. We also tried the meat bun and it was soggy and flavorless. The tea they served hardly had any flavor at all. I strongly suspect they gave us yesterday's leftovers from the quality of the food.In addition the wait staff is horrible and racist as a bunch of other reviews here have mentioned. There is a sign in sheet on the wall but the waiter does not respect it. There was one group that put their name on the list and was waiting patiently for their turn but other people came to the door and yelled that they were next in line so the server gave them the next spot. There was a Chinese family waiting outside and the waiter literally WOULD NOT LET THEM IN before they ordered even though  there were 2 empty tables in the restaurant. One of the family asked if they can order more later since they weren't ready and the waiter said in Chinese \"Why don't you breathe some more fresh air then\". We were inside, had menus and were allowed to order while seated at the table but this Chinese family needed to order outside in the cold? I was so apalled. Maybe it was cus my group had a Caucasian member?Needless to say, me and my friends won't be coming back even though we live in the neighborhood based on food quality and most importantly on principle.\n",

      "Kingdom of Dumpling, while may have some of the best dumplings in the city, the rest of your menu is mediocre at best! Came here on a Friday evening - to no crowd - luckily. Tbh, it was 30mins to the start of the Finals Game 4 though. So I don't think that's the usual wait time. Honestly, came here one other time and wasn't impressed w the food quality. But I was in the area yesterday and thought I'd give KoD another try. Went family style and ordered two apps and two types of dumplings. Got the tofu skin and cold wide bean noodle + fish dumplings and some sort of pork dumpling situation (I don't eat meat sooo idk). If you're not aware of this, they have a sister restaurant in SSF called Dumpling Empire. And it's awesomeeee. One of my fav restaurants. Food quality over there (with the exact same menu) is by far superior to Kingdom of Dumpling. The tofu skin app was totally mushy and over boiled. Uhhhh wth? You only have so many dishes on your menu, it shouldn't be that hard. Then the wide bean noodles seemed a bit undercooked (too chewy). Guys, swap your cooking times or something! Luckily the fish dumplings were standard. Standard as in YUM. But they're made across the street at their Kingdom of Dumpling Wholesale (literally across and one block down), sooo they really just need to boil them. Thank goodness these came out perfectly. Slather the strange looking orange sauce at the table on EVERYTHING. It's their homemade hot sauce. YUM. 3 stars for salvaging the dumplings!\n",

      "In order of fav to least fav: Pork and chive dumpling, Garlic string beans, Beef Chow fun, XLB, Spicy beef noodle soup. The food has declined over the past few years. They still do a decent job on the pork dumplings, but the star used to be XLB. Today the dough texture was strangely brittle when you pick it up with your chopsticks yet mouthfeel was mushy. Flavor was decent, although the ginger soy sauce plays a big part in its balance. Beef chow fun was standard, what I expect out of a Chinese restaurant. The beef noodle soup was bland. Not sure if the owners recognized the Yelp reviews on service, but this time the greeter was too attentive; he asked us if everything was ok about 5 times during our meal, and we were only there for 20 min. But they did take our order while we were waiting for a table, so as soon as we sat down we had our first dish, which I find to be efficient. Not going back again. We'll go back to Dumpling Kitchen just a few blocks away.\n",

I asked the waiter for adequate sauce for each order because they are notorious for being hold outs. He moved toward the back where I could not see him as though he was putting more sauces in the little box.....uh no! So cheap! They have gotten more chintzy and I knew it but thought just maybe... They didn't even give me enough sauce for each of my orders. It should be at least one chili sauce and one vinegar sauce. Mind you the tiny containers aren't even half full.  I wonder if their Chinese customers are treated the same way. 3 stars because dumplings were still delish.\n",

      "Oh my deliciousness, this place is a must try! Tucked in in a little shop, you find amazing, petite sized little mouthfuls of yumminess in each dumpling! This restaurant is extremely small (imagine the size of a kitchen and a small dining room that holds less than 15 people). Extremely cozy and staff are kind. Sitting in close quarters, you can see the chef cook in the background as well- something that is so comforting especially in a small business restaurant.I would have just bypassed this place if I was walking by but thank goodness my little sister found it! Each plate of dumplings has 10 pieces and the soup dumplings have 6. My little sister and I got a plate of shrimp and chives dumpling, a plate of chicken and Napa cabbage dumplings, an order of soup dumplings and an order of fried green beans.The green beans were cooked perfectly with a nice sear to it and perfectly crisp. As she was cooking it, I noticed a flash of flames in the background behind me and I realized those were our green beans cooking, the chef does have some amazing cooking skills!!Our shrimp and chives were so flavorful- lots of chives and a penny sized piece of shrimp in each dumpling but oh so flavorful! The chicken and Napa cabbage dumpling tastes like a dumpling from trader joes but a lot fresher and you can tell the skins of the dumpling are made fresh to order.What are soup dumplings you ask?! It is a steamed dumpling with a small amount of broth in every bite!!!!! At first, I cut it open on my plate and noticed a bit of soup coming out on my plate, then I realized I can put the dumpling on my spoon, bite off a piece of it and sip the soup on my spoon. All in all, for sure I will be coming back to this restaurant!!! Small, quaint, and tucked in with fresh dumplings made to order. Everyone should give this restaurant a try, zagat awarded and prices are well priced!\n",

      "EDIT (5/18/16): Begoni Bistro in Chinatown is xiao long bao king.Kingdom of Dumpling, you have earned your name. Also, you apparently have a twin called King of Noodles in Inner Sunset, which I did not know served xiao long bao! I guess I took your names at face value.This place is quite petite, but the waiter has the best sense of humor. We ordered dumplings and noodles, after which he commented that we didn't have any vegetables. I replied, \"Carbs only!\" and he laughed and said, \"But you're so skinny!\" A+++ for you, my friend.The first dish that came out was the BEEF STEW SOUP NOODLE, $7.45, which you can customize to be spicy (they just throw in some of their homemade orange spicy sauce). My friend wanted it spicy, which, fortunately, is not that spicy for those weak-of-chile. The noodles, like King of Noodles, are homemade, doughy, and not that chewy. The broth is surprisingly light and unsalty in a good way. The meat is thinly-cut beef shank, and some quarters of bok choy and black fungus mushrooms are thrown in for good measure. However, I personally prefer beef chuck cubes over beef shank, so I wasn't in love with the dish.The next dish was the CHICKEN DUMPLINGS WITH GREEN CHIVES, 12 pieces for $6.95. Hearty filling, delicious dumplings. I like it.Third dish was the SHANGHAI SOUP DUMPLINGS (xiao long bao), 6 pieces for $4.95. The dumplings are shaped as thin peaks rather than wide blobs, which is a change of pace. The thickness of the wrapper is on par with that of Dumpling Kitchen, the soup is plentiful, but the amount of pork filling is somewhat lacking.Same issue with quantity of meat applies to their SHANGHAI PAN FRIED SOUP DUMPLINGS (sheng jian bao), which, despite the English description, contain no soup. $4.95 for 4 pieces, which is kind of pricey... BUT. Even though their meat insides are quite minuscule, they do the best job with a light, fluffy breading, shaped into a cute bun, fried golden brown on the bottom and topped with sesame seeds and chopped green onions on top. This has been the least dense and least oily of the sheng jian baos I've tried in the city, which makes it my favafav.Dumpling Kitchen for xiao long bao, Kingdom of Dumpling for sheng jian bao and an ego booster.\n",

Then, she sent the wrong dumplings to us, and argued that we said it wrong. We ordered a noodle soup dish with wonton, and the wontons were the wrong wontons.

When I asked a waitress about my order, she rudely walked away from me and didn't respond. From what we already have eaten, my husband and I are completely not impressed. The string beans were soggy and tasteless. The spicy wontons were small and had little to no meat in them. This has been quite an unpleasant experience with no apologies.Update: Another waitress said we had to wait because they had so many online orders. Since when did online orders take precedence over customers actually seated and waiting forever in the restaurant?! Not a good excuse.

I told her I will let my husband order some more when he gets there. Then I saw her put the order in her pocket. So I asked her if she can get started with the order and to my big surprise she said \"you can only order once\". Whaaaat? Luckily for me I recently found Dumpling Era which is much closer to me, cleaner, bigger and the dumplings are just as good. BTW I know for a fact that kingdom doesn't wash the inside of the tea cups.\n",

      "Great dumplings best that I've had in SF and Taiwan.  The habenero sauce is off the hook hot the way I like it, so be careful. The place is super small so the  lunch and dinner can be a long wait.Dumplings are full of juice and silky soft skin which makes it different from all others. The garlic green beans are also fresh and crispy. They also have a separate store front a few blocks down from the restaurant were you can buy some dumplings to bring home to cook.\n",

I ordered for delivery and food arrived timely but I was surprised how the portions are small.  Also, most of the items I ordered have a sour taste and most are bland except for that vinegary taste. I ordered the sesame bean pancake and I opened the box and found transparent noodles & strips of veggies.... no bean cake, no sesame. The crispy chicken wings are not that crispy, 6 pcs for $8.95 (same price with that sesame bean cake without the sesame and bean), the chow mein is greasy and tasteless ... I called to check about that sesame bean cake but there was a language problem. NEVER AGAIN! Will I order or go to this place. This place is overrated and overpriced. There are other places with more palatable food and justifiable pricing (willing to pay a price if the food is delicious, pleasurable and has quality.)\n",

He thanks every one for coming and thanks customers for their patience when waiting for a table. It's a small restaurant but because of their delicious food, they have lines out the door so please take this into consideration. Parking might be a bit of a drag since it's tucked away in Sunset residential areas so street parking only.\n"

      "Came here with my boyfriend and a friend on a Saturday night, around 8 pm, for dinner. There was no wait for us! Yes! But beware. Kingdom of Dumpling is the perfect definition of \"hole-in-the-wall.\" This place is TINY. We had to put a chair on the side, making a two seat table to accommodate three people. My first thought was, \"Wow this place is tiny.\" Then it became, \"Wow, how am I supposed to pig out with such a tiny table!??!!\" It's a real problem! What if I want to order the whole menu?! Unfortunately, we didn't have the stomach to order the whole menu. Instead, we went with two orders of their Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings), one order of pork and chive dumplings, one XO beef chow fun, and one onion pancake. The food was ready very fast! Their Xiao long bao were done really nicely. They weren't sweet and the soup was yummy. However, there wasn't enough soup in some of them. Some of them just looked like plain dumplings -- all dried up on the inside! I also wished that they had more flavor as well. NEEDS MOAR MSG!!!!!!!The pork and chive dumplings were juicy and really delicious! The skin of the dumplings was a little on the thick side but I love that! It gives it a little chew. And you know what else is great with these dumplings? THEIR HOT SAUCE. Their hot sauce is filled with minced garlic and peppers. It was spicy and delicious! It went wonderful with the dumplings! I think by the end of the night, I had about 4-5 spoonfuls of the deliciousauce! The XO beef chow fun was pretty much beef chow fun. Why is it called XO? I don't think there was a gram of XO sauce in that thing haha! It was pretty decent regardless. It had enough of that wok aroma! Gotta eat it when it's still hot/warm though! The onion pancake? It was really oily but it was still very good. It did lack the stretchiness that I typically love. It was also a little bit more thick than what you would imagine it to be but that's fine. It tastes good and my boyfriend gobbled pretty much the whole thing up! If you need the restroom, you'll have to venture past their tiny kitchen to get to it (but hey at least they got one right?!). Surprisingly, the bathroom is not as tiny as you would think it is. It's actually quite roomy.:) I would definitely come back for their dumplings and hot sauce. Everything was sooooo yummy!\n",

      "SERVICE: If you speak Mandarin, service will be fantastic. If not, well, there's one dude who speaks English somewhat and he usually takes the orders. He also always recommends the garlic string beans without fail. They are pretty quick with the orders so if you're in a rush to go somewhere, you may want to consider a quick lunch here! FOOD: Most things on the menu do not exceed $9. Just be mindful of how much you order. Seriously. Everything is so cheap that I need to constantly keep myself from ordering half the menu. To get a little taste of all they have to offer, I'd recommend 1 order of a dozen dumplings (I love the lamb and chives dumplings), 1 order of flat noodle soup with dumplings (comes with 6 more of your choosing), and of course, the garlic string beans. That's enough to share between 2 people. Their dumplings are very juicy and seasoned well, that's what separates them from the rest. ATMOSPHERE: Small place. It's not unusual to see a line of people outside this place on the weekends. Restaurant traffic flows pretty quickly so it's not a bad wait most of the time. This place is dirty/sticky too. But after writing several reviews like this, I'm starting to believe all the best places to grub are like this too. I'm going to choose to believe that these places choose to pour all their energy and resources into their food, hence the lack of time and funds for restaurant upkeep!\n",

The shanghai soup dumpling wasn't as juicy and the chow fun was SOOOO oily. The dumplings... I guess you can't go wrong with them.

      "Small little joint with great aspects.And when I say small, I mean like 7 tables, tops. The 4 of us came in on a Thursday around 7pm and we lucked out with no wait.We had 3 orders of the XLB, dumplings with corn, dumplings with pork and chives, tripe,and string beans. I can't say that it's the best I've ever had but it tastes close to a homecooked meal. The dumplings with corn came with a good amount of meat and corn. The chives were a bit strong for me and the tripe was a new taste to my pallet. It was slightly crunchy but noodle-like? With a hint of spice and oil. But it wasn't bad! The green beans had a crunch mixed with pepper flakes. Yum!Lastly, for what everyone comes here for, their XLB... I thought the skin was a good amount of thickness that didn't require extra chewing or too much captivation of the soup. There was a decent amount of meat and the soup was minimal.. Which I appreciated! I've visited other dumpling places after this one and it's been hard to beat!\n",

      "Nestled along Taraval street, a street with a dozen other Asian cuisine restaurants, Kingdom of Dumpling definitely stands out. The Kingdom of Dumpling uses their own, hand-made dumplings that reflects in their cooking. Their pork and corn dumpling is juicy and the corn has a perfect balance of saltiness and sweetness. This restaurant gives a perfect example of combining flavors from Beijing and Shanghai with their classic Xian's Long Bao. These small dumpling life buns are filled with meat and juice inside. I would 10/10 recommend this restaurant if you are willing to wait a long line with a dozen other eager eaters.\n"

Tea was just nearly just clear boiled water. So we let it sit for a few mins. It was still pretty much the same. I guess there wasnt much tea leaves in the tea. On to the dumplings. Nothing amazing or special about it. Dare i say, I could barely remember what it tasted it like. You know, like eating frozen dumplings. So it wasnt bad, but it wasnt great either. it just felt like food. We got a lamb skewer, nothing special, took almost 30 mins for a skewer.  Lastly, when we paid, the change we got back was a mess. Bills were crinkled and not stacked. Coins were all over the table.  If it wasnt for the money, I wouldve given this place a 3.  I'm paying you, at least take some care and thought into things.do yourself a favor, go up a few blocks and go to the dumpling kitchen instead. tasted better and wont throw down a bunch money on your table.\n",

      "It's been amazing to see this little hole in the wall dumpling shop grow into its \"kingdom.\" About 10 or more years ago, I would walk by this tiny shop in the evenings and it would usually be empty with just the owner inside. Over the last half decade, it has exploded with popularity and now, the place is always packed with a regular group of people waiting outside. Their dumplings are soothing and delicious! I always order the pork and napa cabbage dumplings, which has a nice soft skin and subtle juicy flavors in the dumplings. Although the flavors by itself are not heavy, it pairs perfectly with the soy sauce/vinegar provided. I also love their garlic string beans and garlic cucumbers, very fresh, flavorful, and crunchy. The beef pancake is a pretty good size and tastes good also. It is a little oily, but that is to be expected with these types of pancakes. Recently, I tried their beef stew noodle soup, which has a nice and soothing soup broth with plenty chunks of beef stew, soft and delicious noodles, fresh bok choy, and mushrooms. This would be perfect for a cold day.A couple items we ordered that I think I can skip next time - the salt pepper tofu and the green onion pancake. The salt pepper tofu lacked a good salt pepper flavor and instead, kind of had a little odd flavor to it. It was a little bland. The green onion pancake was not bad, but it should be ordered with traditional small dishes that compliment the green onion pancake. By itself, it was a little plain and a little dry.  It was HOT inside the little restaurant. We sat at the table next to the kitchen, which made it even hotter. The owner and staff were very attentive and talkative. Although I do like eating here, I usually don't like to wait long for a table. I definitely would recommend this restaurant, but incase you don't like to wait, you can come before or after peak lunch/dinner times...OR you can buy frozen dumplings from their to-go shop on Taraval and bring them home to cook.\n",

So ok... my boyfriend wanted the green chives pancake and the waiter said \"errr can't. That takes 35 mins to make order some other pancake\" and he ordered beef pancake instead. When we finished with our order he moved on to another party and asked what they want to order. When he ordered the green chives pancake the waiter just ok with it and went in with the order (we're both Chinese and the other guy is Caucasian). We were both there and heard the whole thing and thinking wth. My boyfriend went inside, complained about it, and asked them they can order that how come we can't??? The waiter only respond to \"hmmm let me think about it...\" so we left! We didn't read the reviews on this place before hand about them being preferential to non-Asian customers but damn!

      "Decor:  We were seated right away on a Saturday afternoon and tea was poured almost immediately.  The interior is a little sanatorium-esque with all white walls, and the specials are written on paper taped to the walls... in guess what color?  :P White - no way!  Tables are covered with checkered table cloths under glass top.  The signs taped to the dirty window overlooking the street are crumply and stained.  The signs taped to the walls are outdated, bragging of dishes that have been offered for years, purporting them as \"new\" (per my boyfriend, who has been there many times in the past).  Ordering experience:  It was slightly difficult to order because of the language barrier with our server.  He also pressured us into expanding our order with another dish, and by our own fault, we chose a dish that ended up being our least favorite by a large margin.  We were not even that hungry to begin with and we shouldn't have succumbed.Food:Jellyfish with cucumbers and carrots - BLAND 1/5Tofu skin with cilantro - SALTY and terrible, also, the pieces of tofu that were stuck together were a little undercooked. 0/5In my opinion, both non dumpling dishes should be better flavored.  Either work on the non-dumpling items, or remove from the menu.Pork and chive dumplings and soup dumplings were fine. The dumpling skin is thick and white in color, not the most appetizing looking.  My boyfriend said it tasted better before, and it has gone slightly downhill at least in presentation.  For example, they used to plate the soup dumplings on top of Napa cabbage. Now it is presented on top of wax paper. 4/5When asked how everything was, I told the waiter the tofu skin wasn't my favorite and he said nothing.  Wait staff was nice enough but did not do anything to ensure we had a good experience.I wouldn't mind the ambiance and look of the restaurant if it could back it up with spectacular food.  This was just kind of a hole in the wall with average quality dumplings and below average other offerings.  Disappointing.\n",

Each item came with a good number of dumplings for the price (I think 10 for all but the soup ones). The order came with only one tiny thing of dumpling sauce with was far too little given the number of dumplings. It tasted as expected, but about 3x more would have been easily used.The vegetarian dumplings were pretty flavorless, and clearly the equivalent of mystery meat but for vegetables (a mash of vegetables with no big chunks or anything clearly identifiable). It was probably mostly cabbage. The shrimp in the shrimp dumplings was really good, but there was only 1-2 little pieces per dumpling!!! I'd say 90% of the filling volume was chive, meaning that if you ate the dumpling in two bits, you really only got 1 with shrimp in it. The soup dumplings looked the best and after a little zap in the microwave there was actual soup in them. I didn't try them, but I was told they were far and away the best part of the meal.The outside of the dumplings was solid, a good thickness and texture. Overall, I think I'll try another place next time which is a bummer since there are not a lot of dumpling delivery places.\n",

After looking thru yelp, we ordered the XLB (6), green string beans w/ garlic, pork & Napa cabbage dumplings (12), green chives pancake (2 cut into 4 pieces) & spicy beef noodle soup. All were pretty good for the price you pay. I would def recommend the green chives pancake; it was very crispy and full of flavor!! The XLB was ok. The dumplings seemed like they were boiled for a bit too long as the skin was soggy and was about to rip. I would not recommend the spicy beef noodle soup because the soup base tasted like water with a HINT of beef flavor & they used chili oil to make it spicy. The best part about the noodle soup was the beef itself-- very tender and flavorful. It's too bad the soup and noodles couldn't complement it. Service was great.

      "3Jul2016; 11:30a -- WHAT A DUMP -- My chef partner and I left after one bite of dry braised string beans which were tasteless, swimming in diluted soy sauce and less garlic than I have ever seen...REALLY, and a small order that was made with 3 other orders and split up...  The dumplings arrive on trays in the trunk and floor of a silver Nissan uncovered...  The place, walls, chairs, etc. is FILTHY...  And the bathroom was DISGUSTING with the toilet backed up first thing upon opening, toilet paper lying about on the floor and window sill, and a plastic tarp outside the window covered in grease...With all of the fantastic dumpling restaurants in town, some with hand made pulled noodles to boot, why would ANYONE EVER GO TO THIS HOLE?  OMG, it was a pure disaster for anyone who enters...  There aren't enough exclamation marks to describe it properly!!!!!!!!!!\n",

      "Lamb dumplings and chicken and corn dumplings my friends. Any spicy dumpling and Farmers Cucumber. 5 stars on flavor. Not going to be a snob about a dumpling house and write mean reviews when I know what to expect. We re not eating at the Rosewood or Four Seasons people and realize your reviews could hurt people's livelihoods. Just sayin.\n",

      "Dumpling place in the sunset neighborhood, the name of the place explains what they do well. They serve a few other Chinese dishes but stick to the dumplings. They have a pretty decent variety of dumplings with fillings of pork, chicken, shrimp with various vegetables. I personally liked their steamed soup dumplings which were steamed just right not to make the soup inside too scalding hot to eat. Tried the pork and shrimp dumplings with chives and the chicken with chives. The pork and shrimp were ok but unremarkable, the chicken dumplings in my opinion were the better. The chicken tasted juicy and worked well with the chives. Also ordered the fried soup dumplings which weren't my favorite, it was a bit too doughy for my tastes. Ended up also ordering some wings and string beans. The wings were meh, I wouldn't recommend them. The string beans were a surprise as they were very flavorful and the string beans themselves were fresh and crunchy. The place is tiny so expect a wait on busy times. The food here I'd say is reasonably priced. FYI they only do 1 credit card per table so have cash or venmo ready if you're going with friends. I lucked out coming here right as they opened so there was no wait but if there is a long wait, I'd say you'd be better off elsewhere unless you're having a major dumpling craving. Overall good dumplings in a small place in the sunset for cheap but not worth a wait imo.\n",

      "I was hesitant because I'm a yelp star snob and I don't like trying places less than 4 stars, especially when I'm on vaca with limited meals lol. BUT I am SO glad I put my snobbish attitude away that morning and came to House of Dumpling. It was amazing...+ garlic green beans - I seriously wish these were bottomless. I could eat these grean beans all day. SO SIMPLE, but soo good. Perfect crisp and flavored to perfection.+ tried SO many dumplings and literally ALL of them were good... but my highlights were the **chicken & corn** and the **pork & chives**. SO delicious. Make sure you eat them shortly after they're served. If you let them cool down too much, they're good but not AS good. The shanghai pan friend soup dumplings were also good if you're trying to go for something different. I still prefer the regular style XLB's.  + ASK FOR THEIR HOUSEMADE CHILI SAUCE. Loved it.The absolute opposite vibe of Din Tai Fung at South Coast in OC. A complete hole-in-the-wall... screen door and everything. I'm surprised they haven't expanded because they're so popular. Anyway, the food is still top-notch and highly comparable. My bestie lives walking distance from this place. Idk how she resists ordering dumplings and green beans everyday...................\n",

      "I find it amusing that Kingdom of Dumpling looks like a dumpling kitchen, and Dumpling Kitchen looks like a kingdom of dumpling.  The first time I passed by Kingdom of Dumpling, I was honestly unimpressed.  It is a indeed a hole-in-the-wall, but not in the cutesy romanticized sense--it's small and modest with no Instagrammable ambiance, and it doesn't help that the red-and-white plaid plastic tablecloths look out-of-place like they have been transplanted from Bucca di Peppo.  But nothing can stop me in the never-ending quest for the perfect XLB.We started with the CILANTRO BEAN CURD, which was refreshing and makes you feel healthy (if I ever go through a vegetarian phase, Taiwanese bean curd noodle will definitely be a staple).  The chewy tofu texture is the QQ-est of all noodles, and whatever mystery sauce they use complements the soy flavors very well: an appetizing appetizer.The PORK AND NAPA CABBAGE DUMPLING tasted deliciously homemade and I especially liked how light it was.  Dumplings at some places use pork so fatty it's almost sickening, but you can devour the Dumplings of the Kingdom and still have space in your stomach for more of their other amazing foodMy honest opinion of the XLB is that it is a good honest attempt with nicely balanced soup and pork flavors.  However the skin is horrendously thick and chewy--for any XLB snobs that make comparisons to the DTF/Crystal Jade (which are such juggernauts it seems like they engineer their XLB to perfection).  It also has a bit of a funny look that reminds me of stiff peaks (yes I've been baking lately) so your food porn may be a little silly. I was excited to try the green chive pancake which looked like pockets of chivey goodness, but they said they sold out se we replaced it with the BEEF PANCAKE.  The beef could arguably be bland, but on the plus side that means it wasn't too salty.  The pancake was toasty, and like the rest of the food here, I really liked the light, (relatively) healthy, homemade cooking style.  It's like I just became best friends with someone who can cook delish TW/Shanghai food from family recipes.Total after tax was ~$25.. whaaa!  (Or in Chinese lingo, I guess it should be waaah!)  In the Parkside Three Kingdoms for dumplings (the other two being Dumpling Kitchen and House of Pancakes), I think Kingdom of Dumping wins.Tip: They have another location on Taraval that sells frozen dumplings!  They should call it the Kingdom of Dumpling kitchen just to troll with Dumpling Kitchen\n",

      "This place is very tiny. We got here around 6:30PM on a Tuesday and the place only had 2 tables open. By the time we left at around 7:30PM, there were probably 2 or 3 parties waiting outside.Dumplings - We got the chicken & corn and the lamb & veggie. They were decent at best. The dumplings here are definitely on the smaller side. The dumpling skin is too thick for my liking.Shanghai Pan-fried Buns (5) - One look at the dish and I was already disappointed. An order comes with 4 tiny little buns. Shengjianbaos are supposed to have soup on the inside but these not only had no soup, they also barely even had any pork filling. We waited 30 minutes for these and they were so not worth it.Garlic green beans - Tasty but definitely too salty.Overall, I'm unimpressed.

When asking if we can do a take out order instead after waiting 30 minutes we were told \"not right now\". Never coming back here again. Will be going to House of Pancakes instead. Better customer service and food.\n",

      "I have been coming here for a couple years of now and got to say that it has been slightly declining in terms of service and taste. Don't get me wrong, their soup dumplings and beef tendon are still my fave dishes, BUT it just seems like the portions are smaller and the taste is not as glorious as it once has been. Here is what is currently still good: -Beef Tendon : OMG great subtle sauce and texture. A must get. -Soup dumpling - smaller than before and less juice but still packs a punch especially combined with their spicy sauce and ginger infused soy sauce. Hit or Miss: -The shrimp/chive dumpling doesn't really have a lot of shrimp anymore, but it still is super filling and made perfectly. -The chow mein is on the super salty side the past times I have come - still hits the spot, but warning on salt level. -Chive pancake - a little expensive for a pancake and not as fat and large as before. Still tasty for a starter. In terms of wait, the wait is semi long (30 min to an hour at times) especially after 5:30, but it is worth it if you really are craving some dim sum!! The servers are super nice and sometimes don't understand what you are trying to say, but they mean well and do their best. I would recommend coming here on a weekend afternoon or getting take out if you want to skip the wait :)\n",

If you are in search of this kind of cuisine then I say this place is a must.  I will go again. I look forward to taking friends. The restaurant itself is a small hole in the wall. Be prepared to stand in line. The inside is old and in need of help. The zaggot awards gave it 25 out of 30 for food, 6 out of 30 for decor. The staff is a bit rude and that may be a bit because their English is limited. However, the food is excellent!!!\n"

Sharp garlic and chives taste.Shanghai soup dumplings were delicious, but compact.Pork dumplings with cabbage were my favorite.  Not a sharp garlic taste or after taste of garlic like the pork dumplings with chives, but a clean, smooth taste.As other Yelpers have noted, we were told our three orders were not enough for our small party of three.  That seems to be a standard tactic.  One one hand, ordering more is bound to be tasty because of this restaurant's reputation.  On the other hand who enjoys being scolded to by the waitstaff.\n",

      "Disappointing.  We've ordered chicken green chives dumplings, radish cakes, and sesame beef pancake.  To my surprise the waitress said that this is not enough food for two people and we should order more food.  So I've added an order of chicken Chinese spinach dumplings.  First came the chives dumplings.  They tasted good.  Then there was a pause in service and we had nothing on our table.  After a 10 minute break came chicken spinach dumplings.  They also tasted good, but I could not tell the difference between them and chives dumplings, which we just ate.  Honestly, at this point we were pretty full, but since we were asked to order more food, we continued to wait for the next dish.  After a 15 min break or so, they brought some kind of deep-fried sandwiches.  I could not tell what dish they were, so I asked what they were and was told that those are sesame beef pancakes.  They are not regular pancakes as green onion pancakes, but sliced bread buns which were either deep-fried or baked in oil under a press with small pieces of beef inserted in the middle.  They should be called what they are -- deep-fried sandwiches.  Calling them pancakes is misleading. They tested exactly like they looked as deep-fried pressed hamburger buns with beef in the middle. I did not care for the taste; not a tasty combination.  Radish cakes were OK, but bland and not very tasty.  After spending long time sitting around empty table and waiting for the next dish and then filling up on deep-fried sandwiches, I can't say that it was a good experience.  Will not be going back.\n",

      "2.5 STARS for Take OutSo I was in the area and since the roommate didn't want to wait for a table, we decided to get take out. Placed an order on Eat24 and got a confirmation my order would be ready in around 30 mins. I showed up around 30 mins later. When I walked in, no one would acknowledge me. When I finally talked to one of the ladies clearing a table, she checked in with someone from the kitchen. She told me to wait outside so I walked outside. After some back and forth between the employees, a man walked over to me and told me they didn't get my order. I mentioned that eat24 confirmed it, but he said since they have 2 locations, the boss who confirmed the order was at the other location so he hadn't sent the order to this restaurant yet. So I gave him my order again and waited outside. At this point, the roommate had been circling around cuz parking in this area sucks. So now I had to tell him it'd be another 20 mins. He found a place to pull over but this was super annoying to say the least! The guy who took my order kept saying 5 more mins even though I knew it would take longer. We finally got our order and went home. We ordered the following:Crispy chicken wings ($5.95)Shrimp dumpling with green chives ($6.95)Shanghai soup dumpling ($4.95)Shanghai pan fried soup dumpling ($4.95)Pork pot sticker ($5.95)Beef pancake ($5.95)XO beef chow fun ($6.95)Garlic string beans ($6.95)I actually enjoyed a lot of the non dumpling dishes. The string beans were crunchy and flavorful. The XO beef chow fun had a good amount of beef and bean sprouts. The beef pancake was filled with delicious layers of beef. The dumplings were actually a disappointment. Not sure if it was cuz we got take out, but the Soup dumplings lost all their soup. The Shrimp dumpling with green chives was mostly chives and not so much shrimp.I might come back to sit down and eat since I really wanna try the deliciousness of the XLB that everyone seems to have experienced. But I'll probably never get take out from them again. If you decide to order online, make sure to call them to confirm!\n",

      "Kingdom of Dumpling tastes like home to me. Beijing, Northern China home. Everything, from the hole-in-the-wall location that boasts of ten cramped tables at most, to the authentic handmade dumplings, to the \"大妈\" in the back of the kitchen yelling orders is nostalgic. If you're not familiar with Northern Chinese cuisine, you should know that it's on a whole not known for its stir-fried dishes, but rather for its flour-based foods such as noodles, bready pancakes, and most of all, dumplings. I sampled a variety of three kinds of dumplings this time around, and I was incredibly impressed. One thing that's important to note is their policy for no add-on orders. You must order everything at once.  If you're looking for to-go frozen dumplings, you have to go to their other location a couple blocks away, as this location only serves as a restaurant. They also provide each table with old-school dipping sauce: black vinegar with ginger slivers (yelp.com/biz_photos/king…).Sliced pig ear appetizer (cold, spicy if desired):(yelp.com/biz_photos/king…)I thought this cold appetizer dish was well-made. Pig ears are cartilaginous in the middle and soft on the outside, so it creates a contrast of textures on its own. The sauce was just the right amount of saltiness, and we added on some spiciness to give it some more kick. I think this would have been good without the spiciness as well though.Lamb dumplings:(yelp.com/biz_photos/king…)These are probably the heaviest dumplings out of the three that I tried, but the flavor was quite good. Lamb has that gamey taste, but even without too many other ingredients, the flavor of that wasn't overwhelming here. Dipped into the black vinegar to cut the grease, these were really good. I might still prefer the chive and napa cabbage and pork ones more though.Pork and chive dumplings:(yelp.com/biz_photos/king…)Super authentic, and really delicious. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful, but the filling wasn't overly salty either. The dumplings were boiled perfectly (three times!) so that they were cooked all the way through but the wrappers were still elastic. The chives were plentiful and cut (not chopped) to a good size. Probably my favorite rendition of pork and chive dumplings in the states.Pork and napa cabbage dumplings:(yelp.com/biz_photos/king…)Napa cabbage has a more subtle flavor, probably the most subtle of the vegetables used in dumplings, and it's easy to try and overcompensate for it. But not here! The ratio of pork to napa cabbage was spot-on, and the flavor was really good. Again, these were perfectly boiled and I loved the elasticity of the handmade wrappers. I can't remember the last time I had such authentic, homey dumplings.. possibly before my grandma passed away. I'll definitely be back, although it'll be hard to try their other fare since I already have my heart set on their chive and napa cabbage dumplings..\n"

      "Dare I say the soupiest shanghai soup dumplings in SF? I think so. We came around 8:30pm on a Saturday, and our table of four was seated immediately. I think we were pretty lucky, because a few other groups came after us, and they had to wait for table. As for the shanghai dumplings, each had a huge mouthful of soup in each one. The soup to meat ratio felt like 2:1. There actually wasn't all that much meat in each dumpling; it was mostly soup! The dumpling skin wasn't especially thin, but I guess that made easier to pick up. The dumplings were served PIPING HOT, so I'd recommend letting them cool for a good few minutes before popping the whole thing in your mouth. Other good dishes were::: Farmer's cucumber - classic pickled cucumber served in China. Bonus, they use ORGANIC cucumber. :: Cold wide bean noodle - another good starter dish with cucumber and bean noodle. It has a similar flavor to the farmer's cucumber though, so I'd probably order one or the other.:: Pork and corn dumplings - the corn gives a nice hint of sweetness to the dumplings. Very authentic. :: Pot stickers - the skin has a nice chewy texture, and the bottom is slightly crispy. They had originally botched up this order, and they made a whole new order for us. The boss paid high attention to quality! Wish they had told us this rather than wait for us to ask about it before explaining.Dishes I'd pass on: :: Pan-Fried Buns (Sheng Jian Bao) - the bottom wasn't crispy enough, and the bread was soggy from the soup. I've definitely had better.:: Canned soda - not served cold, and no ice.The boss made the whole experience that much better, because he was extremely attentive to every table -- I don't know how he did it! He heard every comment that we made, even though he was rushing around serving dishes and taking orders. He was also very friendly and constantly came back to check that we were doing well. Great service, but he could've communicated better about the pot stickers instead of waiting for us to ask about it. Awesome that they take credit card!\n",

I've been coming here since circa 2009, and it was recommended to us by the staff at Benu (they know a good XLB). We would drive from Stanford to go to this place regularly.

The Beef Noodle Soup had a very good broth and the beef was very tender. The service here is not very attentive, as they did not refill our tea despite the restaurant being empty.

In addition, their pan fried pork buns are also really good, reminding me of the ones I tried in China.The only suggestion is that since the restaurant is really small, in order to avoid the line during the weekend, you need to get there right when they open. I haven't gone there during weekdays but i am sure it is less crowded.\n",

As soon as we finish with one or two, another dish came out, etc. Food was delicious and satisfying, probably also because we were hungry, but owner/manager really created a nice atmosphere for this small restaurant and so we also left in good spirits. We ordered a variety of items (from dumplings to XLB  to onion pancake to beef chow fun to beef noodle soup) and I'd have to say that the dumplings are as good as everyone says they are and I'd just order a few of those next time or try to buy them frozen to take home.One star off for the typos in the menu.\n",

      "This is a classic hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. It is cramped and warm from the fire in the kitchen and I love it so so much! As with many Chinese restaurants, they excel at certain dishes and the rest is mediocre.  I've eaten here at least once every other month for many years and I still love it. Their orange hot sauce is house made mouthwatering. If you want to have more Kingdom of Dumpling in your life, you can walk down the street to their wholesale and buy bags of dumplings from their freezers. Here's the tasty bites you should try!Appetizers: Ma La Niu Jin (spicy beef tendon) - It's the best tendon dish I've had. It's thinly sliced to perfection and easy to eat. I've fed it to many unsuspecting, unadventurous eaters who loved it. Tofu noodle with cilantro - It's a very simple dish. It's light, fresh and satisfying.Cong you bing (green onion pancake) - It's delicious and crunchy. I make it at home so I don't usually buy it, but it's great. Dumplings:  My favorite are the lamb dumplings and pork with chive. The rest are amazing as well, although I would not recommend the fish dumplings or the vegetarian dumplings since the filling texture is too mushy. Sheng jian bao - pan fried buns with soup are excellent. I don't think they're listed in the menu but they always have them! Don't get their xiao long bao (soup dumplings). Often times they soup has already drained out of them and the skins are a little too thick. Stick with the dumplings and walk down the street to Dumpling Kitchen for your XLB. Mains: Fried string beans are delicious. You may feel like you're making a healthy choice by eating green beans but these babies are definitely pan fried in a thick layer of oil before they make it out to your plate. Enjoy!\n",

      "I was really craving some home cooked Chinese food last weekend and went to great lengths to get it! I've had Kingdom of Dumplings bookmarked for a while and decided to try it one night so I picked up three of my friends from Embarcadero and Fillmore to come here. This area is not very public transportation friendly apparently! We came on a Sunday night and street parking was fairly easy to find. There were around 4 groups of 2 to 4 people ahead of us. The restaurant is pretty tiny and doesn't seat very many people so it was always packed. The wait was surprisingly short though and not too bad. Service was super friendly as well. This restaurant was a little overhyped in my opinion but I still enjoyed it and it satisfied my craving for a home cooked meal. String beans 4/5 - I loved dipping my dumplings in the soy sauce that came with these string beans. XLB and dumplings 4/5 - We ordered two dumplings and one XLB. They all came out hot and fresh but I still like my mom's XLB and dumplings better. Beef pancake 4/5 - This was good! I've never had pancake with meat inside. Chicken wings 3/5 - For some reason, I was expecting the fried salt and pepper chicken wings so I was surprised when these came out. The wings were sweet but not too flavorful. Chow Fun 2/5 - There wasn't enough sauce or flavor. This ranks maybe at the bottom of the list of chow fun I have tried. After dinner, we walked around for dessert and found Marco Polo ice cream down the street. I would definitely recommend going there for an after dinner treat!\n",

My favorite is the shrimp and chive, which admittedly is 80% garlic chive and 20% shrimp, but I think it tastes better that way anyway. I also love the beef noodle soup, both spicy and regular. The broth is on the clear-ish side with a bit of five spice seasoning. Don't expect a dark brown Taiwanese style broth- this isn't that. My only complaint about this place is that they no longer use hand-pulled noodles though- now they just use standard factory made flour ones.\n",

They have a delicious homemade hot sauce on each of the 9 tables in this tiny restaurant. Friendly service but something got lost in the translation. Instead of a lunch size portion of hot  & sour soup, a small bowl, they brought a GIANT bowl. I explained that's not what I ordered but they wouldn't take it back.

      "On a quest to find some fantastic dumplings on a budget? You will not need to venue too far from Taraval Street, which blends in the Parkside Neighborhood and outer Sunset District. This neighborhood happens to be home to several of the best Chinese dumpling houses in the city without having to shell out a premium price. The options for stellar dumplings may be plentiful. Kingdom of Dumpling, however, may be my personal favorite. The dumplings here are superb! They are 100% handmade in-house daily and delicious.These Beijing style dumplings are characteristic for their thicker, more doughy skins. The texture, however, was almost velvet-like soft. The pork and other main ingredients wrapped inside the skins came piping hot, juicy and so flavorful. Xiaolongbao or Shanghai Soup Dumplings (12), $9.90 - their prized soup dumplings were prepared flawlessly! The skin was soft to the touch but kept enough firmness to hold its texture. The meat actually bounced in the broth inside. The soup was still simmering hot and the pork, customarily rolled up into a ball, was unbelievably tasty. They were right up there on my short list of the best xia long bao I have tasted.The other dishes we ordered I would highly recommend as well.Pork Dumplings with Green Chives (12), $5.95 - one of my favorite dumpling combinations because these green garlic chives really enhances the flavor of pork. You get a hint of garlic as you bite into each juicy morsel. Pork and Shrimp Dumplings (12), $6.45 - I always order this combination and it is a good barometer of how special the dumplings are. Both the flavors of the pork and shrimp really came through and had just the right amount of firmness, not overly cooked. The juiciness of the shrimp indicated its freshness and that it was not frozen prior.Pork Dumplings with Napa Cabbage (12), $5.95 - another undeniably delicious combination. There is just enough cabbage to marry the flavor of pork and balance the saltiness. It also added texture to the meat.Shanghai style donuts (2) , $2.95 - a gooey flour dough, topped with sesame seeds, and filled with warm sweet red beans. It was incredibly delicious and a wonderful surprise.The preparation and taste of the dumplings here are hard to match. In a neighborhood known for many stellar and competing dumpling houses, Kingdom of Dumpling reigns supreme!\n"

We were seated immediately, and decided to order the chow mein, shanghai pan-fried buns, and sizzling rice soup. The chow mein was made with hand pulled noodles and was super tasty! The pan-fried buns were probably my favorite dish; they were sooo crispy on the outside and had pork filling on the inside. The pork filling was super juicy and yummy and reminded me of the filling in xiao long baos. I only wish that there was more of the dumpling skin on the outside. The sizzling rice soup had good flavor but the rice wasn't crispy like how it is at San Tung. Kingdom of Dumpling has such delicious food that I would disregard the below average service to eat it.

Spicy dipping sauce for beef tendons adds a \"kick\" I really enjoy that.Beef chow fun was good also. Noodles were fresh, crunchy julienned cabbage and beans spout makes a great dish. Just add a touch of soy sauce for more flavor. I least enjoy the fried rice. Rice was hard and dry, lack of flavor. I would enjoy better if they sweat the onions before adding the rice and the rest of ingredients. Portion size was satisfactory for the price.

The pea shoots with garlic are very tasty as was the eggplant with garlic. It definitely had spice but was not so hot that I didn't like it (I can't stomach food is too spicy). The soup dumplings are made perfectly as is everything else. Word to the wise. For the soup dumplings make sure they cool off or you'll burn your mouth. It is best to put in the soup ladle, bite the top and let it cool for a second. I did this and was not scorched by the hot hot and tasty soup inside.

I am ready to discard this Restaurant into the trash. \\xa0You may notice the reviews are suddenly getting to be pretty bad despite 2000 counting. \\xa0A really bad sign that it's about to close or be sold to an idiot who will be what's about to close.Yes dumplings are made off site at their other hole in the wall on noriega and they transport them in the trunk of their Lexus SUV and Toyota Camry car trunk. \\xa0Yes on trays openly exposed to the elements dust what have you. \\xa0Proudly walks in with them on cafeteria trays and plops them somewhere in back.This in front of lines of people waiting out front so no secret there. It's gone on for years and I figure their frozen and then steamed until hot and cooked so no biggie.Let's talk about the food . \\xa0It used to be order some dumplings even ask what's freshest \\xa0and enjoy \\xa0the slightly palpable freshness of what they had and then order what your standards are to fill out the meal. \\xa0I'd get the xiao lum bao of course, soup dumpling is actually pretty good and usually not broken so the broth inside can be enjoyed. \\xa0Having spent time in shanghai in my youth these are an important part of any dumpling meal.The kale and pork, chive and pork, lamb and carrot, even some others were all fine many times. I would always order some garlic string beans, some cucumber salad or the garlic marinated rehydrated mushroom salad,( called garlic fungher on the menu,) maybe so salt and pepper fried tofu. \\xa0Pretty good stuff for a long time. Over the course of the last 5 to 6 years quite a few good meals.Now for the bad: \\xa0be warned I admit to suffering through a incredibly bad experience to witness total ethical failure of this restuarant to do business honestly and fairly.I can in recently on July 2nd of 2019. \\xa0First I made it early before the real rush and was their at like 530. \\xa0I waited a very long time as special party ate in what is now their waiting area in the adjacent space and also a serving area now. \\xa0The staff were incredibly rude and short and ignoring everyone and I slowly began to realize something was actually wrong in the kitchen. \\xa0Having eaten here many times I trooped through it and waited longer and longer while I could see they weren't turning dishes out of the kitchen. \\xa0Something was wrong. \\xa0Something bad. \\xa0Fast forward to the end of our meal. \\xa0We've noticed our dumplings are under cooked , we've noticed all the dumplings which means frozen and require steam are coming out one at a time and are soggy I e not steamed but boiled in pot of water because they had like the entire stove failing which means it was dangerous for them to even be using it. \\xa0I did get an upset stomach from eating food which normally wouldn't have fazed me even slightly. \\xa0And the following day when I drove ny I found them shut down by the health department. \\xa0So.. I apologize to you all now. \\xa0I knew something was wrong and I wanted to barge in the kitchen with my camera rolling and say what the %? I should have but we will never get the real story out of these people. \\xa0I paid, tipped and will continue eating $$$ worth of food in other places and never support his joint again as they refused to be honorable and shut the place down themselves when it was obviously broken I was watching through the kitchen window as the one older lady slowly kept stirring her one pot of boiling water trying to cook dumplings. \\xa0When you run a business serving food in city like San Francisco and you dont have the integrettly to shut down because you cant make food you are a piece of garbage and deserve to be sued right out of business. \\xa0I advise anyone who ate here July 1, or 2, of 2019 to consider sharing their experience here and on google reviews to broadcast the clear culpability of the ownership, management, and staff, who were 100% complicit in serving unsafe food knowingly and with attitude to boot. \\xa0They do not deserve another chance.* Beer is lucky to be cold, even as proprietor hawks them happily asking if people want another round. \\xa0I dont know where he got the idea that a good sales technique is offer more beers when you just put them in the fridge and they are in no way actually cold. \\xa0I know many people especially chinese will say dont drink cold liquid with your meal but if your hawking beer it better be cold.\",\n",

Pan fried dumplings were not available, either.The service went from mystifying to rude, depending on the staff member we were interacting with, but the dumplings were tasty enough that I'd definitely frequent Kingdom of Dumpling again, but ONLY via carryout or delivery.

I'm also a big fan of the appetizers, we often get the soy bean noodles and beef tendon. My only food compliant is that the soup of the noodle soups can be a bit salty !

We had no issues with the service, food was brought out pretty quickly. Chicken fried rice was too oily, shanghai soup dumplings were so over cooked--the wontons were hard and barely any soup left, the fried Shanghai soup dumplings had no soup and probably only a gram size of meat inside. The pork in our dumplings were bland. We also ordered beef noodle soup, with not enough beef!

So folks, buckle up your seatbelts for a scathing and unforgiving few paragraphs (kidding but seriously, get ready). The service:I usually don't comment on the service as they are usually the same or standard all around. And even if it is a Chinese restaurant (which are INFAMOUS for their bad service), that does not excuse bad service. (And no, a yelp review I read about this restaurant, a dirtier kitchen and crappier service is NOT equivalent to better food. What a hilariously ignorant thing to say.) I had the honor of choosing the restaurant to eat at this week and mistakenly chose this place. We had tried to wave down the wait staff for approximately 10 minutes (and if you've seen the teeny tiny size of this place. You literally cannot miss anyone unless you are blind.) Instead or tending to the guests, one of the wait staff picked up the phone, another one listened in on the phone call, and another was standing in front of the waitress writing something down. Either way, there was three of them on a phone call where there should only be one. But that is not all, they had decided HMMM PERHAPS WE SHOULD SQUEEZE 4 GROWN PEOPLE ON A TABLE FOR TWO. GOOD IDEA YES. Like ?????? It is acceptable if the place was packed. \\xa0But when a party of four left, PLEASE PLEASE MOVE US TO THE TABLE. We had just sat down and my anxiety a** could not handle ASKING YOU TO MOVE US. But perhaps that was on me and my fellow family members. But I would not base my review SOLOLY on the service. The food seemingly MATCHED THE POOR SERVICE AS WELL. DA RAVED ABOUT FOOD: First thing first. If this restaurant was not in SF or any place with real Chinese people and real Chinese food, it would righteously be a hit in the so unfortunate small town. But in San Francisco where almost everywhere you turn there is a chinese (but you couldn't seem to find a chinese person in this restaurant and now I know why), this is a shame on our name. The food was overall BLAND. TO THE CORE. If this is supposedly USA's Top 100 Chinese Restaurants, then there must be only 100 Chinese restaurants in America because there is NO WAY it has made the list. (Unless the food has rapidly changed.)1. Xiao Long Bao: worse than Kome's. And that's saying something. (2/5)2. Crispy Chicken Wings (or something like that): this was a new thing on their menu (or so they claim) and it was definitely new. Because the recipe for this must be half finished because it was bland. The sauce had a small SMALL hint of sweetness and then it quickly died. The chicken was just chicken. It as fine but... not good. 3. Chow Mein: 3/5 this was decent. It was average. It was normal. \\xa0But there was as much bean sprouts as there were noodles so if you don't like bean sprouts, beware. 4. Pork Dumplings with Corn (2/5) now I've never had corn in my dumplings and I've still never had it. Because if they put corn in that, I am shocked. 5. Soup noodles with Wonton (the thick noodles): 3/5 it is like the noodles you eat when you are sick. So it's bland (which is what I think it's supposed to taste like) and the soup itself is okay. The wontons are just... like I could buy frozen ones and keep them frozen and it would be better than this. 6. Beef pancake: 3/5. It's like an onion pancake but beef inside. Normal and would recommend as everything else on the menu is seemingly trash. Also, not a smart idea to have an open kitchen when I could see and count with my hands and toes and then need to borrow someone else's, the health violations being performed only 20 feet away. I love that.\",\n",

However - all tables around us were seated with at least one non-Chinese descent patron.

Jamie must have been in a takeout mood because he ordered the $7.95 XO Chicken Chow Mein which turned out to be a hefty portion of thick noodles mixed with the standard vegetables and again heavy on the greasy side (photo: bit.ly/2ogwHN2).I went with one of the specials way above my head on the whiteboard, the $13.95 Rack of Lamb with Rice. It wasn't a rack like Jayne Mansfield has a rack. It was three grilled lamb chops. The plate came with a bowl of rice, a dipping soy sauce, and three lonely asparagus spears - their idea of a gourmet dinner (photo: bit.ly/2oo5qsB).

What I didn't know was just how many dumpling houses there are on Taraval. I counted at least three within a four or five block radius. This one is small and unassuming, bordering on basic. I think they have about 8 tables. All of which were full during our lunch. The tables are close and it gets noisy, but you are still able to have a decent conversation if you want. They have an extensive menu, so it's good for sharing. It's not good for a long, lingering anything. Because it's small, and people seem intent on eating and moving on, this is not a place to linger. We did, but if I were to go here again, this would not be the place I would pick. Again, it's small. I don't think they even have a restroom. However, it seemed pretty clean. And I liked the fact that the staff sat down for a group lunch towards the end of our visit. Seeing staff eat the food always makes me more confident in my choice of eating establishment. There are many reasons why that might be a crazy notion, but it works for me. So, based on all the other reviews, you must be wondering about the service. Well, they were fast. The food was hot. they kept the tea flowing. Based on what I already told you, you might suspect that is as good as it gets. It is, but I'm not sure what people expect. Not every place is going to be a five star, white glove affair. I think people go here to eat good food at a reasonable price. Anything else they get is just gravy. Go for a wide selection of yummy dumplings. This is NOT a go to destination, but it is wonderful if you happen to be in the neighborhood. It's a solid 3.5 stars.\",\n",

Caucasian guests are seated before Asian guests regardless of the wait list, and Asian guests are often denied certain orders and basically service for no reason, other than to provide better service to non-asian guests. Go through the review history, this has apparently been an issue recently. Management was not always like this, and as a neighbor, I used to frequent this restaurant quite often.Avoid it like the plague, there's no place for racism in 2019.\",\n",

There are plenty of spots nearby for all sorts of vehicles. I tried the lamb dumpling and it tastes good.

We then tried to order Shanghai style pan fried dumplings- but the man taking orders waved his hand at us and shook his head. \\xa0No more? I asked. No you order 2 fried items already- too many fried items. Huh?!? \\xa0I was confused. That's ok I said- I want to order the pan fried dumplings. He said no, only 2 fried items allowed. What?!? That's weird. So to clarify I asked: so I cannot order the pan fried dumplings? No too many fried items. Uhhhh. Ok nvm then. Strike 1. We are seated and they bring over the dishes and cups. There was soy sauce stains all over my plate and all over the tea pot. Strike 2. The food came and the soup dumplings were actually quite delicious- with skin not too thick and not too thin. The broth in the dumplings was quite flavorful. The steamed dumplings were ok. Standard fare nothing special. Then came the fried onion pancakes, which are my favorite. This one had a good crisp, but not too flakey. However 2 bites in I lost my appetite when I saw to curly pieces of hair stuck on my pancake. It looks like it was stuck in the batter so took a little effort to pull out. Ugh lost my appetite. Strike 3.

Sitting in close quarters, you can see the chef cook in the background as well- something that is so comforting especially in a small business restaurant.I would have just bypassed this place if I was walking by but thank goodness my little sister found it! Each plate of dumplings has 10 pieces and the soup dumplings have 6. My little sister and I got a plate of shrimp and chives dumpling, a plate of chicken and Napa cabbage dumplings, an order of soup dumplings and an order of fried green beans.The green beans were cooked perfectly with a nice sear to it and perfectly crisp. As she was cooking it, I noticed a flash of flames in the background behind me and I realized those were our green beans cooking, the chef does have some amazing cooking skills!!Our shrimp and chives were so flavorful- lots of chives and a penny sized piece of shrimp in each dumpling but oh so flavorful! The chicken and Napa cabbage dumpling tastes like a dumpling from trader joes but a lot fresher and you can tell the skins of the dumpling are made fresh to order.What are soup dumplings you ask?! It is a steamed dumpling with a small amount of broth in every bite!!!!! At first, I cut it open on my plate and noticed a bit of soup coming out on my plate, then I realized I can put the dumpling on my spoon, bite off a piece of it and sip the soup on my spoon. All in all, for sure I will be coming back to this restaurant!!! Small, quaint, and tucked in with fresh dumplings made to order. Everyone should give this restaurant a try, zagat awarded and prices are well priced!',\n",

Also, you apparently have a twin called King of Noodles in Inner Sunset, which I did not know served xiao long bao! I guess I took your names at face value.This place is quite petite, but the waiter has the best sense of humor. We ordered dumplings and noodles, after which he commented that we didn\\'t have any vegetables. I replied, \"Carbs only!\" and he laughed and said, \"But you\\'re so skinny!\" A+++ for you, my friend.The first dish that came out was the BEEF STEW SOUP NOODLE, $7.45, which you can customize to be spicy (they just throw in some of their homemade orange spicy sauce). My friend wanted it spicy, which, fortunately, is not that spicy for those weak-of-chile. The noodles, like King of Noodles, are homemade, doughy, and not that chewy. The broth is surprisingly light and unsalty in a good way. The meat is thinly-cut beef shank, and some quarters of bok choy and black fungus mushrooms are thrown in for good measure. However, I personally prefer beef chuck cubes over beef shank, so I wasn\\'t in love with the dish.The next dish was the CHICKEN DUMPLINGS WITH GREEN CHIVES, 12 pieces for $6.95. Hearty filling, delicious dumplings. I like it.Third dish was the SHANGHAI SOUP DUMPLINGS (xiao long bao), 6 pieces for $4.95. The dumplings are shaped as thin peaks rather than wide blobs, which is a change of pace. The thickness of the wrapper is on par with that of Dumpling Kitchen, the soup is plentiful, but the amount of pork filling is somewhat lacking.Same issue with quantity of meat applies to their SHANGHAI PAN FRIED SOUP DUMPLINGS (sheng jian bao), which, despite the English description, contain no soup. $4.95 for 4 pieces, which is kind of pricey... BUT. Even though their meat insides are quite minuscule, they do the best job with a light, fluffy breading, shaped into a cute bun, fried golden brown on the bottom and topped with sesame seeds and chopped green onions on top. This has been the least dense and least oily of the sheng jian baos I\\'ve tried in the city, which makes it my favafav.Dumpling Kitchen for xiao long bao, Kingdom of Dumpling for sheng jian bao and an ego booster.',\n",

Over the last half decade, it has exploded with popularity and now, the place is always packed with a regular group of people waiting outside. Their dumplings are soothing and delicious! I always order the pork and napa cabbage dumplings, which has a nice soft skin and subtle juicy flavors in the dumplings. Although the flavors by itself are not heavy, it pairs perfectly with the soy sauce/vinegar provided. I also love their garlic string beans and garlic cucumbers, very fresh, flavorful, and crunchy. The beef pancake is a pretty good size and tastes good also. It is a little oily, but that is to be expected with these types of pancakes. Recently, I tried their beef stew noodle soup, which has a nice and soothing soup broth with plenty chunks of beef stew, soft and delicious noodles, fresh bok choy, and mushrooms. This would be perfect for a cold day.A couple items we ordered that I think I can skip next time - the salt pepper tofu and the green onion pancake. The salt pepper tofu lacked a good salt pepper flavor and instead, kind of had a little odd flavor to it. It was a little bland. The green onion pancake was not bad, but it should be ordered with traditional small dishes that compliment the green onion pancake. By itself, it was a little plain and a little dry. \\xa0It was HOT inside the little restaurant. We sat at the table next to the kitchen, which made it even hotter. The owner and staff were very attentive and talkative. Although I do like eating here, I usually don\\'t like to wait long for a table.

Tried the pork and shrimp dumplings with chives and the chicken with chives. The pork and shrimp were ok but unremarkable, the chicken dumplings in my opinion were the better. The chicken tasted juicy and worked well with the chives. Also ordered the fried soup dumplings which weren't my favorite, it was a bit too doughy for my tastes. Ended up also ordering some wings and string beans. The wings were meh, I wouldn't recommend them. The string beans were a surprise as they were very flavorful and the string beans themselves were fresh and crunchy. The place is tiny so expect a wait on busy times. The food here I'd say is reasonably priced. FYI they only do 1 credit card per table so have cash or venmo ready if you're going with friends.

Placed an order on Eat24 and got a confirmation my order would be ready in around 30 mins. I showed up around 30 mins later. When I walked in, no one would acknowledge me. When I finally talked to one of the ladies clearing a table, she checked in with someone from the kitchen. She told me to wait outside so I walked outside. After some back and forth between the employees, a man walked over to me and told me they didn't get my order. I mentioned that eat24 confirmed it, but he said since they have 2 locations, the boss who confirmed the order was at the other location so he hadn't sent the order to this restaurant yet. So I gave him my order again and waited outside. At this point, the roommate had been circling around cuz parking in this area sucks. So now I had to tell him it'd be another 20 mins. He found a place to pull over but this was super annoying to say the least! The guy who took my order kept saying 5 more mins even though I knew it would take longer. We finally got our order and went home. We ordered the following:Crispy chicken wings ($5.95)Shrimp dumpling with green chives ($6.95)Shanghai soup dumpling ($4.95)Shanghai pan fried soup dumpling ($4.95)Pork pot sticker ($5.95)Beef pancake ($5.95)XO beef chow fun ($6.95)Garlic string beans ($6.95)I actually enjoyed a lot of the non dumpling dishes. The string beans were crunchy and flavorful. The XO beef chow fun had a good amount of beef and bean sprouts. The beef pancake was filled with delicious layers of beef. The dumplings were actually a disappointment. Not sure if it was cuz we got take out, but the Soup dumplings lost all their soup. The Shrimp dumpling with green chives was mostly chives and not so much shrimp.I might come back to sit down and eat since I really wanna try the deliciousness of the XLB that everyone seems to have experienced. But I'll probably never get take out from them again. If you decide to order online, make sure to call them to confirm!\",\n",

       " ['Kingdom of Dumpling tastes like home to me. Beijing, Northern China home. Everything, from the hole-in-the-wall location that boasts of ten cramped tables at most, to the authentic handmade dumplings, to the \"大妈\" in the back of the kitchen yelling orders is nostalgic. If you\\'re not familiar with Northern Chinese cuisine, you should know that it\\'s on a whole not known for its stir-fried dishes, but rather for its flour-based foods such as noodles, bready pancakes, and most of all, dumplings. I sampled a variety of three kinds of dumplings this time around, and I was incredibly impressed. One thing that\\'s important to note is their policy for no add-on orders. You must order everything at once. \\xa0If you\\'re looking for to-go frozen dumplings, you have to go to their other location a couple blocks away, as this location only serves as a restaurant. They also provide each table with old-school dipping sauce: black vinegar with ginger slivers (yelp.com/biz_photos/king…).Sliced pig ear appetizer (cold, spicy if desired):(yelp.com/biz_photos/king…)I thought this cold appetizer dish was well-made. Pig ears are cartilaginous in the middle and soft on the outside, so it creates a contrast of textures on its own. The sauce was just the right amount of saltiness, and we added on some spiciness to give it some more kick. I think this would have been good without the spiciness as well though.Lamb dumplings:(yelp.com/biz_photos/king…)These are probably the heaviest dumplings out of the three that I tried, but the flavor was quite good. Lamb has that gamey taste, but even without too many other ingredients, the flavor of that wasn\\'t overwhelming here. Dipped into the black vinegar to cut the grease, these were really good. I might still prefer the chive and napa cabbage and pork ones more though.Pork and chive dumplings:(yelp.com/biz_photos/king…)Super authentic, and really delicious. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful, but the filling wasn\\'t overly salty either. The dumplings were boiled perfectly (three times!) so that they were cooked all the way through but the wrappers were still elastic. The chives were plentiful and cut (not chopped) to a good size. Probably my favorite rendition of pork and chive dumplings in the states.Pork and napa cabbage dumplings:(yelp.com/biz_photos/king…)Napa cabbage has a more subtle flavor, probably the most subtle of the vegetables used in dumplings, and it\\'s easy to try and overcompensate for it. But not here! The ratio of pork to napa cabbage was spot-on, and the flavor was really good. Again, these were perfectly boiled and I loved the elasticity of the handmade wrappers. I can\\'t remember the last time I had such authentic, homey dumplings.. possibly before my grandma passed away. I\\'ll definitely be back, although it\\'ll be hard to try their other fare since I already have my heart set on their chive and napa cabbage dumplings..',\n",

       " [\"Dare I say the soupiest shanghai soup dumplings in SF? I think so. We came around 8:30pm on a Saturday, and our table of four was seated immediately. I think we were pretty lucky, because a few other groups came after us, and they had to wait for table. As for the shanghai dumplings, each had a huge mouthful of soup in each one. The soup to meat ratio felt like 2:1. There actually wasn't all that much meat in each dumpling; it was mostly soup! The dumpling skin wasn't especially thin, but I guess that made easier to pick up. The dumplings were served PIPING HOT, so I'd recommend letting them cool for a good few minutes before popping the whole thing in your mouth. Other good dishes were::: Farmer's cucumber - classic pickled cucumber served in China. Bonus, they use ORGANIC cucumber. :: Cold wide bean noodle - another good starter dish with cucumber and bean noodle. It has a similar flavor to the farmer's cucumber though, so I'd probably order one or the other.:: Pork and corn dumplings - the corn gives a nice hint of sweetness to the dumplings. Very authentic. :: Pot stickers - the skin has a nice chewy texture, and the bottom is slightly crispy. They had originally botched up this order, and they made a whole new order for us. The boss paid high attention to quality! Wish they had told us this rather than wait for us to ask about it before explaining.Dishes I'd pass on: :: Pan-Fried Buns (Sheng Jian Bao) - the bottom wasn't crispy enough, and the bread was soggy from the soup. I've definitely had better.:: Canned soda - not served cold, and no ice.The boss made the whole experience that much better, because he was extremely attentive to every table -- I don't know how he did it! He heard every comment that we made, even though he was rushing around serving dishes and taking orders. He was also very friendly and constantly came back to check that we were doing well. Great service, but he could've communicated better about the pot stickers instead of waiting for us to ask about it. Awesome that they take credit card!\",\n",

This neighborhood happens to be home to several of the best Chinese dumpling houses in the city without having to shell out a premium price. The options for stellar dumplings may be plentiful. Kingdom of Dumpling, however, may be my personal favorite. The dumplings here are superb! They are 100% handmade in-house daily and delicious.These Beijing style dumplings are characteristic for their thicker, more doughy skins. The texture, however, was almost velvet-like soft. The pork and other main ingredients wrapped inside the skins came piping hot, juicy and so flavorful. Xiaolongbao or Shanghai Soup Dumplings (12), $9.90 - their prized soup dumplings were prepared flawlessly! The skin was soft to the touch but kept enough firmness to hold its texture. The meat actually bounced in the broth inside. The soup was still simmering hot and the pork, customarily rolled up into a ball, was unbelievably tasty. They were right up there on my short list of the best xia long bao I have tasted.The other dishes we ordered I would highly recommend as well.Pork Dumplings with Green Chives (12), $5.95 - one of my favorite dumpling combinations because these green garlic chives really enhances the flavor of pork. You get a hint of garlic as you bite into each juicy morsel. Pork and Shrimp Dumplings (12), $6.45 - I always order this combination and it is a good barometer of how special the dumplings are. Both the flavors of the pork and shrimp really came through and had just the right amount of firmness, not overly cooked. The juiciness of the shrimp indicated its freshness and that it was not frozen prior.Pork Dumplings with Napa Cabbage (12), $5.95 - another undeniably delicious combination. There is just enough cabbage to marry the flavor of pork and balance the saltiness. It also added texture to the meat.Shanghai style donuts (2) , $2.95 - a gooey flour dough, topped with sesame seeds, and filled with warm sweet red beans. It was incredibly delicious and a wonderful surprise.The preparation and taste of the dumplings here are hard to match.
